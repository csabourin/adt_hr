00:00:00.013 --> 00:00:02.483
Good labour relations are essential to

00:00:02.484 --> 00:00:04.801
good human resources management.

00:00:04.777 --> 00:00:06.793
It is your responsibility to contribute

00:00:06.785 --> 00:00:08.451
to effective labour relations in your

00:00:08.458 --> 00:00:10.903
organization and to ensure that the

00:00:10.897 --> 00:00:13.464
Federal Public Sector Labour Relations Act,

00:00:13.474 --> 00:00:15.686
labour relations policies and collective

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:18.184
agreements, and the National Joint Council

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:19.765
directives are respected and

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:22.661
applied in a consistent manner.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.001
The Federal Public Sector Labour Relations Act

00:00:24.998 --> 00:00:27.620
provides for dialogue, joint problem solving,

00:00:27.606 --> 00:00:29.427
mutually agreed-upon solutions,

00:00:29.416 --> 00:00:31.477
and effective collective bargaining.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.329
The preamble of the Act outlines key values

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.051
and principles, such as the importance of

00:00:37.051 --> 00:00:39.563
mutual respect and harmonious labour-management

00:00:39.548 --> 00:00:41.442
relations to support a healthy

00:00:41.435 --> 00:00:43.920
and productive workplace;

00:00:43.914 --> 00:00:46.981
serving and protecting the public interest, and

00:00:46.972 --> 00:00:48.889
fair, credible and efficient resolution

00:00:48.878 --> 00:00:50.658
of workplace issues.

00:00:50.661 --> 00:00:52.530
Under the Federal Public Sector

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:55.021
Labour Relations Act, deputy heads must

00:00:55.006 --> 00:00:56.896
establish labour-management consultation

00:00:56.887 --> 00:00:58.722
committees and informal conflict

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:01.761
management systems (or ICMS).

00:01:01.743 --> 00:01:04.242
In this section you will become familiar

00:01:04.218 --> 00:01:06.054
with the basic process for determining

00:01:06.052 --> 00:01:08.674
a managerial or confidential position,

00:01:08.674 --> 00:01:10.864
learn how to use collective agreements

00:01:10.864 --> 00:01:13.492
to make decisions, and discover the

00:01:13.489 --> 00:01:15.128
resources available to help you

00:01:15.102 --> 00:01:17.424
manage workplace conflict.

00:01:17.405 --> 00:01:18.593
This section should take you

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.653
approximately 20 minutes to complete.

00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:24.742
Essential positions are defined as

00:01:24.742 --> 00:01:26.352
jobs that maintain the services,

00:01:26.343 --> 00:01:28.373
facilities and activities of the

00:01:28.361 --> 00:01:30.275
federal public service and that are

00:01:30.263 --> 00:01:32.634
or will be necessary for the safety

00:01:32.626 --> 00:01:35.444
or security of the public.

00:01:35.433 --> 00:01:37.316
Under the Federal Public Sector Labour

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.492
Relations Act (Division 8), the employer

00:01:39.492 --> 00:01:41.772
holds the authority and responsibility

00:01:41.757 --> 00:01:45.337
for determining essential positions.

00:01:45.328 --> 00:01:47.581
As a delegated manager, you are responsible

00:01:47.572 --> 00:01:50.620
for identifying the positions that

00:01:50.608 --> 00:01:52.293
include duties which are necessary

00:01:52.293 --> 00:01:54.983
to providing essential services,

00:01:54.971 --> 00:01:56.653
providing rationales and supporting

00:01:56.641 --> 00:01:58.983
documentation (such as organizational charts

00:01:58.968 --> 00:02:00.884
and work descriptions) in support of

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.561
designations to your labour relations

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.120
organizational advisor, and

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.531
after a position has been designated,

00:02:07.506 --> 00:02:09.280
notifying the incumbent about the

00:02:09.264 --> 00:02:10.652
related implications -

00:02:10.622 --> 00:02:13.370
a notice that may be sent by email.

00:02:13.352 --> 00:02:14.816
For more information, see the

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.306
Guidelines for Essential Services Designations.

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.616
Having managerial or confidential duties

00:02:20.593 --> 00:02:22.342
means that these positions are excluded

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.651
from a bargaining unit. Section 59 of the

00:02:25.633 --> 00:02:27.923
Federal Public Sector Labour Relations Act

00:02:27.895 --> 00:02:30.562
lists the grounds for declaring a position

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:33.342
managerial or confidential, but departments

00:02:33.323 --> 00:02:35.584
play a key role in identifying and

00:02:35.566 --> 00:02:37.144
justifying these positions to the

00:02:37.137 --> 00:02:39.633
Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat.

00:02:39.638 --> 00:02:41.610
For more information, see the Guidelines

00:02:41.598 --> 00:02:45.472
on Managerial or Confidential Exclusions.

00:02:46.413 --> 00:02:48.602
Collective agreements specify the terms

00:02:48.598 --> 00:02:50.574
and conditions governing employee

00:02:50.558 --> 00:02:53.532
and employer rights and entitlements.

00:02:53.518 --> 00:02:56.143
They also address key elements such as

00:02:56.127 --> 00:02:58.432
leave entitlements, hours of work,

00:02:58.437 --> 00:03:01.441
remuneration, and so forth.

00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:03.131
Different collective agreements may

00:03:03.106 --> 00:03:05.131
appear to be quite similar, but they

00:03:05.128 --> 00:03:06.961
contain important differences in

00:03:06.948 --> 00:03:10.611
entitlements that you must recognize.

00:03:10.591 --> 00:03:12.842
In your new role as a manager, it is quite

00:03:12.825 --> 00:03:15.301
possible that you will manage employees

00:03:15.301 --> 00:03:18.372
under more than one collective agreement.

00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:20.402
Make sure you read them and are able

00:03:20.401 --> 00:03:22.383
to answer questions that may arise

00:03:22.381 --> 00:03:24.612
among your employees.

00:03:24.608 --> 00:03:26.423
You should also be aware that directives

00:03:26.418 --> 00:03:28.632
developed by the National Joint Council

00:03:28.627 --> 00:03:30.813
affect collective agreements.

00:03:30.795 --> 00:03:33.051
National Joint Council provisions form

00:03:33.056 --> 00:03:34.472
part of the collective agreements

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:36.192
of the participating parties under

00:03:36.181 --> 00:03:39.044
the bylaws of the National Joint Council.

00:03:39.018 --> 00:03:42.012
The provisions also apply to individuals

00:03:41.983 --> 00:03:43.762
not covered by collective agreements,

00:03:43.762 --> 00:03:45.632
such as specified in the directive

00:03:45.623 --> 00:03:47.582
or by employer policy.

00:03:48.798 --> 00:03:50.518
The Financial Administration Act

00:03:50.507 --> 00:03:52.441
authorizes every deputy head in the

00:03:52.431 --> 00:03:54.480
core public administration to establish

00:03:54.453 --> 00:03:56.461
standards of conduct and to set penalties

00:03:56.461 --> 00:03:58.526
as disciplinary measures.

00:03:58.524 --> 00:04:00.177
Penalties that may be applied

00:04:00.164 --> 00:04:02.518
for misconduct include suspension

00:04:02.515 --> 00:04:05.214
or termination of employment,

00:04:05.206 --> 00:04:07.530
oral or written reprimands,

00:04:07.528 --> 00:04:09.789
demotion to a position at a lower maximum

00:04:09.764 --> 00:04:13.673
rate of pay, or other financial penalties.

00:04:13.663 --> 00:04:15.612
Disciplinary measures, as opposed to

00:04:15.602 --> 00:04:17.226
performance management measures,

00:04:17.204 --> 00:04:18.797
may be the appropriate response to

00:04:18.771 --> 00:04:20.428
an employee’s willful breach of

00:04:20.432 --> 00:04:23.256
rules or standards in the workplace.

00:04:23.233 --> 00:04:25.916
A grievance is a formal administrative

00:04:25.915 --> 00:04:28.187
process that employees can use to seek

00:04:28.175 --> 00:04:29.966
the resolution of disputes regarding

00:04:29.941 --> 00:04:32.554
the terms and conditions of their employment.

00:04:32.526 --> 00:04:34.994
The Federal Public Sector Labour Relations Act

00:04:34.986 --> 00:04:36.884
gives all employees the right to

00:04:36.886 --> 00:04:39.624
present grievances, unless there is

00:04:39.606 --> 00:04:41.803
an administrative alternative.

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:43.310
Employees are entitled to present

00:04:43.281 --> 00:04:45.442
a grievance if they feel aggrieved

00:04:45.436 --> 00:04:47.220
by the interpretation or application of

00:04:47.206 --> 00:04:49.099
statutes, regulations, directions or

00:04:49.079 --> 00:04:50.559
other instruments that deal with

00:04:50.554 --> 00:04:52.683
terms and conditions of employment,

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.383
by a provision of a collective agreement

00:04:54.367 --> 00:04:56.253
or an arbitral award, or

00:04:56.252 --> 00:04:58.763
as a result of any occurrence or matter affecting 

00:04:58.752 --> 00:05:01.265
their terms and conditions of employment .<br>

00:05:01.252 --> 00:05:03.755
When you receive a grievance from an employee, 

00:05:03.752 --> 00:05:06.755
it is your responsibility as a supervisor or manager 

00:05:06.731 --> 00:05:08.765
to acknowledge receipt to the employee and <br>

00:05:08.731 --> 00:05:11.031
send the grievance form to the person in your 

00:05:11.021 --> 00:05:12.494
organization who is authorized 

00:05:12.471 --> 00:05:14.984
to deal with the grievance.  

00:05:14.961 --> 00:05:16.790
According to the Federal Public Sector 

00:05:16.752 --> 00:05:19.484
Labour Relations Act,  all organizations in the 

00:05:19.461 --> 00:05:21.494
core public administration must have an 

00:05:21.482 --> 00:05:24.705
informal conflict management system in place. 

00:05:24.682 --> 00:05:26.875
The purpose of an ICMS is to resolve 

00:05:26.851 --> 00:05:28.565
workplace conflict by offering 

00:05:28.551 --> 00:05:31.726
alternative dispute resolution methods.   

00:05:32.754 --> 00:05:34.546
Take what you have learned into real life!   

00:05:34.542 --> 00:05:37.106
Your organization will have its own ways of

00:05:37.102 --> 00:05:39.306
 doing things. Take a time out from the course 

00:05:39.292 --> 00:05:41.254
to find out who in your department is 

00:05:41.232 --> 00:05:43.994
the labour relations advisor.  They can offer 

00:05:43.992 --> 00:05:47.104
excellent support.  As well, find out which positions 

00:05:47.092 --> 00:05:49.474
are designated managerial or confidential 

00:05:49.472 --> 00:05:52.646
in your team or organization.

00:05:52.642 --> 00:05:54.126
Test your knowledge by answering 

00:05:54.122 --> 00:05:55.486
the following questions. 

00:05:55.462 --> 00:05:57.766
Select “Submit” when you are done.
