00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:14.134
Good labour relations are essential to

00:00:14.124 --> 00:00:16.294
good human resources management.

00:00:16.277 --> 00:00:18.292
It is your responsibility to contribute

00:00:18.295 --> 00:00:20.034
to effective labour relations in your

00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:22.614
organization and to ensure that the

00:00:22.606 --> 00:00:25.367
Federal Public Sector Labour Relations Act,

00:00:25.353 --> 00:00:27.977
labour relations policies and collective agreements,

00:00:27.967 --> 00:00:29.787
and the National Joint Council

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:31.527
directives are respected and

00:00:31.518 --> 00:00:34.177
applied in a consistent manner.

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:36.723
The Federal Public Sector Labour Relations Act

00:00:36.707 --> 00:00:39.329
provides for dialogue, joint problem solving,

00:00:39.316 --> 00:00:41.137
mutually agreed-upon solutions,

00:00:41.135 --> 00:00:43.196
and effective collective bargaining.

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:45.953
The preamble of the Act outlines key values

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.878
and principles, such as the importance of

00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:51.508
mutual respect and harmonious labour-management

00:00:51.498 --> 00:00:53.178
relations to support a healthy

00:00:53.155 --> 00:00:55.268
and productive workplace;

00:00:55.243 --> 00:00:58.388
serving and protecting the public interest, and

00:00:58.351 --> 00:01:00.617
fair, credible and efficient resolution

00:01:00.618 --> 00:01:02.677
of workplace issues.

00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:03.937
Under the Federal Public Sector

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:06.647
Labour Relations Act, deputy heads must

00:01:06.646 --> 00:01:08.536
establish labour-management consultation

00:01:08.527 --> 00:01:10.361
committees and informal conflict

00:01:10.358 --> 00:01:13.383
management systems (or ICMS).

00:01:13.382 --> 00:01:15.923
In this section you will become familiar

00:01:15.908 --> 00:01:17.744
with the basic process for determining

00:01:17.742 --> 00:01:20.762
a managerial or confidential position,

00:01:20.743 --> 00:01:22.542
learn how to use collective agreements

00:01:22.534 --> 00:01:25.152
to make decisions, and discover the

00:01:25.138 --> 00:01:26.777
resources available to help you

00:01:26.762 --> 00:01:29.084
manage workplace conflict.

00:01:29.064 --> 00:01:30.268
This section should take you

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.323
approximately 20 minutes to complete.

00:01:40.852 --> 00:01:42.666
Essential positions are defined as

00:01:42.652 --> 00:01:44.262
jobs that maintain the services,

00:01:44.263 --> 00:01:46.293
facilities and activities of the

00:01:46.291 --> 00:01:48.466
federal public service and that are

00:01:48.462 --> 00:01:50.833
or will be necessary for the safety

00:01:50.816 --> 00:01:53.634
or security of the public.

00:01:53.623 --> 00:01:55.089
Under the Federal Public Sector Labour

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.699
Relations Act (Division 8), the employer

00:01:57.681 --> 00:01:59.961
holds the authority and responsibility

00:01:59.957 --> 00:02:03.537
for determining essential positions.

00:02:03.527 --> 00:02:05.941
As a delegated manager, you are responsible

00:02:05.932 --> 00:02:08.711
for identifying the positions that

00:02:08.707 --> 00:02:10.291
include duties which are necessary

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.931
to providing essential services,

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.601
providing rationales and supporting

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.141
documentation (such as organizational charts

00:02:17.126 --> 00:02:19.043
and work descriptions) in support of

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:20.721
designations to your labour relations

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.031
organizational advisor, and

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.421
after a position has been designated,

00:02:25.406 --> 00:02:27.121
notifying the incumbent about the

00:02:27.114 --> 00:02:28.887
related implications -

00:02:28.872 --> 00:02:31.653
a notice that may be sent by email.

00:02:31.632 --> 00:02:32.873
For more information, see the

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.392
Guidelines for Essential Services Designations.

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:38.675
Having managerial or confidential duties

00:02:38.682 --> 00:02:40.656
means that these positions are excluded

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:42.626
from a bargaining unit. 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:43.936
Section 59 of the

00:02:43.933 --> 00:02:46.223
Federal Public Sector Labour Relations Act

00:02:46.223 --> 00:02:48.516
lists the grounds for declaring a position

00:02:48.498 --> 00:02:51.290
managerial or confidential, but departments

00:02:51.283 --> 00:02:53.544
play a key role in identifying and

00:02:53.536 --> 00:02:55.114
justifying these positions to the

00:02:55.116 --> 00:02:57.612
Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat.

00:02:57.598 --> 00:02:59.570
For more information, see the Guidelines

00:02:59.558 --> 00:03:04.432
on Managerial or Confidential Exclusions.

00:03:09.772 --> 00:03:11.961
Collective agreements specify the terms

00:03:11.957 --> 00:03:13.933
and conditions governing employee

00:03:13.937 --> 00:03:16.681
and employer rights and entitlements.

00:03:16.667 --> 00:03:19.292
They also address key elements such as

00:03:19.276 --> 00:03:22.221
leave entitlements, hours of work,

00:03:22.197 --> 00:03:24.923
remuneration, and so forth.

00:03:24.933 --> 00:03:26.551
Different collective agreements may

00:03:26.524 --> 00:03:28.333
appear to be quite similar, but they

00:03:28.306 --> 00:03:30.140
contain important differences in

00:03:30.138 --> 00:03:33.720
entitlements that you must recognize.

00:03:33.701 --> 00:03:36.580
In your new role as a manager, it is quite

00:03:36.564 --> 00:03:38.740
possible that you will manage employees

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.811
under more than one collective agreement.

00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:43.841
Make sure you read them and are able

00:03:43.841 --> 00:03:45.823
to answer questions that may arise

00:03:45.821 --> 00:03:48.051
among your employees.

00:03:48.048 --> 00:03:49.862
You should also be aware that directives

00:03:49.838 --> 00:03:52.052
developed by the National Joint Council

00:03:52.027 --> 00:03:54.212
affect collective agreements.

00:03:54.193 --> 00:03:56.450
National Joint Council provisions form

00:03:56.455 --> 00:03:57.872
part of the collective agreements

00:03:57.868 --> 00:03:59.592
of the participating parties under

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.443
the bylaws of the National Joint Council.

00:04:02.437 --> 00:04:05.226
The provisions also apply to individuals

00:04:05.212 --> 00:04:06.991
not covered by collective agreements,

00:04:06.992 --> 00:04:08.862
such as specified in the directive

00:04:08.861 --> 00:04:11.426
or by employer policy.

00:04:18.788 --> 00:04:20.507
The Financial Administration Act

00:04:20.497 --> 00:04:22.781
authorizes every deputy head in the

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:24.810
core public administration to establish

00:04:24.801 --> 00:04:26.951
standards of conduct and to set penalties

00:04:26.931 --> 00:04:28.996
as disciplinary measures.

00:04:28.973 --> 00:04:30.161
Penalties that may be applied

00:04:30.152 --> 00:04:33.201
for misconduct include suspension

00:04:33.184 --> 00:04:35.341
or termination of employment,

00:04:35.336 --> 00:04:37.739
oral or written reprimands,

00:04:37.737 --> 00:04:39.997
demotion to a position at a lower maximum

00:04:39.984 --> 00:04:43.893
rate of pay, or other financial penalties.

00:04:43.883 --> 00:04:45.832
Disciplinary measures, as opposed to

00:04:45.831 --> 00:04:47.472
performance management measures,

00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:49.021
may be the appropriate response to

00:04:49.011 --> 00:04:50.667
an employee’s willful breach of

00:04:50.672 --> 00:04:53.496
rules or standards in the workplace.

00:05:00.413 --> 00:05:02.203
A grievance is a formal administrative

00:05:02.185 --> 00:05:04.333
process that employees can use to seek

00:05:04.323 --> 00:05:06.226
the resolution of disputes regarding

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.900
the terms and conditions of their employment.

00:05:08.885 --> 00:05:11.138
The Federal Public Sector Labour Relations Act

00:05:11.125 --> 00:05:13.318
gives all employees the right to

00:05:13.316 --> 00:05:16.054
present grievances, unless there is

00:05:16.055 --> 00:05:18.118
an administrative alternative.

00:05:18.108 --> 00:05:19.609
Employees are entitled to present

00:05:19.611 --> 00:05:21.533
a grievance if they feel aggrieved

00:05:21.524 --> 00:05:23.310
by the interpretation or application of

00:05:23.296 --> 00:05:25.188
statutes, regulations, directions or

00:05:25.168 --> 00:05:26.649
other instruments that deal with

00:05:26.653 --> 00:05:28.782
terms and conditions of employment,

00:05:28.769 --> 00:05:30.545
by a provision of a collective agreement

00:05:30.527 --> 00:05:32.414
or an arbitral award, or

00:05:32.401 --> 00:05:34.911
as a result of any occurrence or matter affecting

00:05:34.912 --> 00:05:37.594
their terms and conditions of employment.

00:05:37.591 --> 00:05:40.093
When you receive a grievance from an employee,

00:05:40.072 --> 00:05:43.074
it is your responsibility as a supervisor or manager

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:44.889
to acknowledge receipt to the employee and

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.919
send the grievance form to the person in your

00:05:46.901 --> 00:05:48.609
organization who is authorized

00:05:48.591 --> 00:05:51.103
to deal with the grievance.

00:05:51.081 --> 00:05:52.704
According to the Federal Public Sector

00:05:52.691 --> 00:05:55.654
Labour Relations Act, all organizations in the

00:05:55.621 --> 00:05:57.724
core public administration must have an

00:05:57.721 --> 00:06:00.754
informal conflict management system in place.

00:06:00.752 --> 00:06:02.945
The purpose of an ICMS is to resolve

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:04.663
workplace conflict by offering

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.989
alternative dispute resolution methods.

00:06:13.794 --> 00:06:16.333
Take what you have learned into real life!

00:06:16.321 --> 00:06:17.673
Your organization will have 

00:06:17.662 --> 00:06:19.623
its own ways of doing things. 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.963
Take a time out from the course

00:06:20.953 --> 00:06:22.553
to find out who in your department is

00:06:22.541 --> 00:06:24.713
the labour relations advisor.  

00:06:24.703 --> 00:06:27.003
They can offer excellent support.  

00:06:26.992 --> 00:06:28.781
As well, find out which positions

00:06:28.781 --> 00:06:31.051
are designated managerial or confidential

00:06:31.041 --> 00:06:34.216
in your team or organization.

00:06:40.251 --> 00:06:41.735
Test your knowledge by answering

00:06:41.722 --> 00:06:43.472
the following questions.

00:06:43.461 --> 00:06:47.572
Select “Submit” when you are done.
