00:00:12.224 --> 00:00:14.343
a key step in helping an organization

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:16.594
achieve its goals.

00:00:16.577 --> 00:00:19.046

00:00:19.018 --> 00:00:21.204

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:23.631

00:00:23.623 --> 00:00:26.914

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:30.884
Federal public service managers and

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.613
human resources professionals must comply

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:36.132
with a variety of policies and legislation

00:00:36.122 --> 00:00:39.415
governing how staffing processes are conducted.

00:00:39.408 --> 00:00:43.222
These laws, regulations and policies support and

00:00:43.207 --> 00:00:46.307
promote impartial appointments, based on merit,

00:00:46.295 --> 00:00:48.642
which help advance diversity and

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.636

recognize considerations for staffing a position.

00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:06.890
This section should take you

00:01:06.882 --> 00:01:11.045
approximately 20 minutes to complete.

00:01:19.811 --> 00:01:21.683
In determining your staffing needs,

00:01:21.663 --> 00:01:24.173
consider various sources of information.

00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:26.693
A few good sources to begin with are your

00:01:26.683 --> 00:01:29.350
business objectives, your organizational goals

00:01:29.338 --> 00:01:32.381
and the public service workforce goals.

00:01:32.375 --> 00:01:34.530
Considering your business objectives when

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:36.994
staffing will help ensure that your programs

00:01:36.973 --> 00:01:40.334
and services are properly managed and delivered.

00:01:40.315 --> 00:01:42.868
For clarity on business objectives,

00:01:42.844 --> 00:01:45.269
consult documents such as business plans,

00:01:45.248 --> 00:01:47.498

When considering your business objectives,

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.753
ask yourself the following questions.

00:01:54.733 --> 00:01:56.741
Do my objectives align with

00:01:56.734 --> 00:01:58.438
the higher-level priorities? 

00:01:58.428 --> 00:02:01.543
And, what qualifications will contribute

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.179
to meeting the business requirements?

00:02:04.162 --> 00:02:06.615
Business objectives are guided by organizational 

00:02:06.617 --> 00:02:09.065
and public service workforce goals. 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.485
Those goals are set

00:02:10.473 --> 00:02:12.320
by the Clerk of the Privy Council,

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.016
the Treasury Board, deputy heads and management.

00:02:17.015 --> 00:02:20.223
Here are some examples of priorities at this level:

00:02:20.222 --> 00:02:21.627
building a diverse, equitable

00:02:21.622 --> 00:02:24.472
and inclusive public service; correcting

00:02:24.466 --> 00:02:26.962

by workforce adjustment;

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.682
and building organizational capacity

00:02:33.673 --> 00:02:36.302
and developing competencies.

00:02:36.295 --> 00:02:37.991
Organizational and public service

00:02:37.992 --> 00:02:40.737

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:42.707

Before you initiate an appointment process,

00:03:23.547 --> 00:03:26.302
it’s important to be acquainted with the legislation,

00:03:26.276 --> 00:03:29.680

The purpose of the Employment Equity Act

00:03:40.522 --> 00:03:42.562
is to achieve equality in the workplace

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.437
and to correct conditions of disadvantage

00:03:44.425 --> 00:03:47.069

members of visible minorities.

00:03:53.838 --> 00:03:56.393
The Act requires that every employer identify

00:03:56.395 --> 00:03:58.751
and eliminate employment barriers against

00:03:58.737 --> 00:04:01.484
persons in the identified groups.

00:04:01.485 --> 00:04:04.230
Employers must also institute positive policies and

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.560
practices and make reasonable accommodations

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:08.853
to ensure their workforce reflects

00:04:08.838 --> 00:04:11.241
the diversity of Canadians.

00:04:12.942 --> 00:04:15.401
The Accessible Canada Act is intended to promote

00:04:15.383 --> 00:04:17.663
the full and equal participation of all persons,

00:04:17.651 --> 00:04:21.295
especially persons with disabilities, in society.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.875
This act strives to proactively eliminate and

00:04:23.862 --> 00:04:26.092
prevent barriers in seven areas under

00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:28.346
federal jurisdiction, including employment,

00:04:28.317 --> 00:04:30.956

00:06:53.117 --> 00:06:55.241
There are three lenses to apply

00:06:55.239 --> 00:06:58.371
when staffing a position: 

00:06:58.366 --> 00:07:01.231

Take into account employment equity objectives <br>

00:07:25.007 --> 00:07:28.257
and adopt inclusive practices.

00:07:28.237 --> 00:07:30.538

of an individual’s right to accommodation.

00:07:40.506 --> 00:07:42.640
Establish effective merit criteria that reflect

00:07:42.608 --> 00:07:45.969
the requirements of the position or work unit

00:07:45.945 --> 00:07:48.559
and consider the organization's business needs.

00:08:00.017 --> 00:08:02.596
Determine who will be eligible to apply

00:08:02.586 --> 00:08:06.087
by establishing the area of selection or recourse.

00:08:06.063 --> 00:08:09.363

to make a fair decision;

00:08:32.787 --> 00:08:35.191
use a variety of complementary sources and

00:08:35.176 --> 00:08:37.151
assessment tools to increase the validity

00:08:37.137 --> 00:08:39.580
and reliability of the assessment;

00:08:39.557 --> 00:08:41.539

00:10:09.627 --> 00:10:12.686
and exercise flexibility by suggesting solutions

00:10:12.678 --> 00:10:14.978
and adaptations for the assessment tools

00:10:14.978 --> 00:10:18.083
and approach in order to ensure a fair assessment

00:10:18.076 --> 00:10:23.941
of each candidate’s qualifications.

00:10:23.926 --> 00:10:26.271
Use one of the flexibilities provided for

00:10:26.258 --> 00:10:28.629
in the Public Service Employment Act.

00:10:28.618 --> 00:10:31.561
For example: focus exclusively on members

00:10:31.528 --> 00:10:33.829
of designated employment equity groups

00:10:33.808 --> 00:10:35.989
or expand the area of selection

00:10:35.966 --> 00:10:39.041
that applies to these groups.

00:10:39.028 --> 00:10:41.081
Establish an organizational need to

00:10:41.048 --> 00:10:42.605
select individuals who have declared

00:10:42.606 --> 00:10:44.442
that they belong to a designated group

00:10:44.438 --> 00:10:47.065
that is currently or is expected to be

00:10:47.036 --> 00:10:49.005
under-represented. 

00:10:49.005 --> 00:10:51.145
In a non-advertised process,

00:10:51.118 --> 00:10:53.242
appoint a person belonging to one

00:10:53.208 --> 00:10:59.025
of the designated groups.

00:10:59.007 --> 00:11:01.003
Make reasonable decisions based on

00:11:00.996 --> 00:11:03.735
valid and reliable information related to

00:11:03.708 --> 00:11:08.436
each candidate and for each process.

00:11:08.428 --> 00:11:11.184
Focus on merit rather than on likeability

00:11:11.187 --> 00:11:13.919
or other sources of bias.

00:11:16.288 --> 00:11:18.920
Be able to clearly explain decisions and

00:11:18.908 --> 00:11:21.139
document appointment information including

00:11:21.126 --> 00:11:24.209
your decisions and considerations.

00:11:34.384 --> 00:11:36.884
Take what you have learned into real life!

00:11:36.865 --> 00:11:38.360
Your organization will have

00:11:38.336 --> 00:11:40.879
its own ways of doing things.

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:43.995
As a last step, locate some essential resources

00:11:43.995 --> 00:11:46.936
to assist you in staffing effectively.

00:11:46.917 --> 00:11:49.769
Your organizational staffing framework.

00:11:49.767 --> 00:11:51.850
The mandate of your organization

00:11:51.826 --> 00:11:53.639
(enabling legislation).

00:11:53.625 --> 00:11:56.950
Your departmental instrument of sub-delegation.

00:11:56.926 --> 00:11:59.534
Staffing policies, direction from the Deputy Head

00:11:59.517 --> 00:12:02.559
and practices of your organization.

00:12:02.546 --> 00:12:04.769
Identify and meet your HR advisors

00:12:04.764 --> 00:12:07.989
and consult them before making decisions.

00:12:07.975 --> 00:12:10.639
And as a sub-delegated manager, you have

00:12:10.615 --> 00:12:12.235
many different options. 

00:12:12.235 --> 00:12:14.671
Remember to consult your HR advisor.

00:12:14.673 --> 00:12:16.650
Take time out from the course to consult

00:12:16.634 --> 00:12:18.471
the Public Service Commission’s Guides

00:12:18.464 --> 00:12:19.892
and Tools web page. 

00:12:19.881 --> 00:12:21.422
These tools are designed

00:12:21.413 --> 00:12:23.150
to assist managers involved

00:12:23.134 --> 00:12:25.433
in the appointment process.

00:12:32.773 --> 00:12:34.423
Test your knowledge by answering

00:12:34.399 --> 00:12:36.260
the following questions.

00:12:36.259 --> 00:12:39.143
Select “Submit” when you are done.
