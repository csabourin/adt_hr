00:00:09.942 --> 00:00:12.071
As a manager, you may be asked

00:00:12.054 --> 00:00:14.282
to perform various HR activities

00:00:14.262 --> 00:00:17.042
such as hire a new employee,

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.196
draft a new job description,

00:00:19.181 --> 00:00:20.734
approve leave requests

00:00:20.719 --> 00:00:22.760
and conduct performance reviews.

00:00:22.754 --> 00:00:24.443
But before you do any of these,

00:00:24.443 --> 00:00:25.786
you will need to know if

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.018
you have the authority to do so.

00:00:28.004 --> 00:00:30.301
You may be delegated key authorities

00:00:30.292 --> 00:00:33.576
in human resources, commonly referred to as HR.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.869
To exercise these authorities appropriately,

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:38.795
you need to understand how they are delegated.

00:00:38.796 --> 00:00:40.875
You must also be able to interpret

00:00:40.843 --> 00:00:43.447
your organization's HR delegation instruments

00:00:43.423 --> 00:00:46.273
and use them efficiently and effectively,

00:00:46.265 --> 00:00:47.536
in consultation with the

00:00:47.521 --> 00:00:49.999
appropriate subject matter experts.

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:51.850
In this section you will learn to

00:00:51.837 --> 00:00:53.780
recognize who delegates authority

00:00:53.767 --> 00:00:56.067
and who receives delegation, and

00:00:56.067 --> 00:00:58.518
identify levels of authority required

00:00:58.508 --> 00:01:01.601
to approve specific HR requests.

00:01:03.725 --> 00:01:05.292
This section should take you

00:01:05.271 --> 00:01:09.364
approximately 15 minutes to complete.

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:20.176
Parliament creates authorities through legislation

00:01:20.161 --> 00:01:22.496
and from here deputy heads receive

00:01:22.475 --> 00:01:24.446
certain HR-related authorities directly

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.518
from legislation and regulations, most

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.442
specifically from the Financial Administration Act

00:01:30.426 --> 00:01:33.631
and the Public Service Employment Act.

00:01:33.616 --> 00:01:35.799
In addition, the Public Service Employment Act

00:01:35.786 --> 00:01:38.251
gives the Public Service Commission the authority

00:01:38.252 --> 00:01:39.500
to make appointments to

00:01:39.495 --> 00:01:41.504
and within the public service.

00:01:41.507 --> 00:01:44.556
The Public Service Employment Act also authorizes

00:01:44.527 --> 00:01:46.412
the Public Service Commission to delegate

00:01:46.411 --> 00:01:48.947
appointment and appointment-related authorities

00:01:48.922 --> 00:01:50.420
to deputy heads, for positions

00:01:50.411 --> 00:01:52.829
within the jurisdiction.

00:01:54.661 --> 00:01:57.446
Human resources authorities are divided into

00:01:57.436 --> 00:01:59.325
directly conferred authorities

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:01.810
and delegated authorities.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.260
Directly conferred authorities are those granted

00:02:07.237 --> 00:02:09.189
directly to deputy heads and

00:02:09.165 --> 00:02:12.501
those granted to the Public Service Commission.

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:14.514
The Public Service Commission may then delegate

00:02:14.504 --> 00:02:18.082
additional authorities to deputy heads.

00:02:19.175 --> 00:02:22.337
An individual may exercise delegated authorities

00:02:22.335 --> 00:02:24.635
once they occupy the position to which authorities

00:02:24.614 --> 00:02:27.270
have been associated, have completed the

00:02:27.273 --> 00:02:30.467
necessary training, and received

00:02:30.453 --> 00:02:34.116
their delegation from the deputy head.

00:02:36.846 --> 00:02:38.971
The Public Service Commission sub-delegates

00:02:38.936 --> 00:02:41.226
most appointments and appointment-related

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:44.022
authorities to deputy heads, who may then

00:02:44.003 --> 00:02:46.275
sub-delegate the majority of these authorities

00:02:46.248 --> 00:02:48.235
to managers.

00:02:48.234 --> 00:02:50.575
This differs from many other HR-related authorities,

00:02:50.564 --> 00:02:53.075
such as leave authorities, which may be exercised

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.225
by virtue of occupying a position,

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:58.137
while others require specialized training

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:00.005
to receive accreditation,

00:03:00.004 --> 00:03:03.345
as is the case for Organization and Classification.

00:03:03.344 --> 00:03:05.995
An individual may exercise sub-delegated authorities

00:03:05.986 --> 00:03:08.145
for staffing once they occupy the position

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.258
to which authorities have been associated,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.393
have completed the necessary training,

00:03:12.365 --> 00:03:14.834
have received the delegation from the deputy head

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.470
and have signed the attestation.

00:03:17.457 --> 00:03:19.550
In the case of appointment authorities,

00:03:19.525 --> 00:03:21.040
they must be exercised by

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:22.997
a duly sub-delegated manager.

00:03:22.997 --> 00:03:24.995
Although many people may be involved

00:03:24.978 --> 00:03:26.625
in the selection process,

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.175
the sub-delegated manager remains accountable

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:33.055
and responsible for all decisions.

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:34.556
For an overview of delegations,

00:03:34.526 --> 00:03:36.141
take a look at the Appointment Delegation

00:03:36.126 --> 00:03:39.326
and Accountability Instrument and review the types

00:03:39.317 --> 00:03:42.096
of authorities directly conferred to deputy heads,

00:03:42.057 --> 00:03:44.126
as well as those granted to

00:03:44.116 --> 00:03:47.508
the Public Service Commission.

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:58.271
Each organization has its own tools to

00:03:58.251 --> 00:04:00.231
delegate authorities appropriately

00:04:00.186 --> 00:04:02.608
through managerial levels.

00:04:02.586 --> 00:04:04.561
Generally speaking, an organization’s

00:04:04.548 --> 00:04:07.691
HR delegation instrument describes a series of

00:04:07.668 --> 00:04:09.864
activities and the authorization level

00:04:09.847 --> 00:04:12.434
or levels associated with it.

00:04:12.435 --> 00:04:14.821
An individual may only exercise authorities

00:04:14.815 --> 00:04:16.221
for which they have received

00:04:16.204 --> 00:04:18.062
appropriate delegation.

00:04:18.064 --> 00:04:21.548
Consult your own organization’s instrument.

00:04:30.975 --> 00:04:33.809
Take what you have learned into real life!

00:04:33.785 --> 00:04:35.478
Your organization will have

00:04:35.466 --> 00:04:37.288
its own ways of doing things.

00:04:37.264 --> 00:04:39.680
As a result, sub-delegation varies from

00:04:39.654 --> 00:04:41.461
one organization to another.

00:04:41.464 --> 00:04:44.259
It is a good practice to question

00:04:44.235 --> 00:04:46.067
if you have the authority to act

00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:48.877
before making an HR decision.

00:04:48.875 --> 00:04:50.517
Take a time out from the course

00:04:50.495 --> 00:04:52.927
and ask your supervisor or an HR advisor

00:04:52.898 --> 00:04:54.848
where you can find your organization’s

00:04:54.824 --> 00:04:57.449
delegation instrument and how it should be used

00:04:57.435 --> 00:05:00.002
for the decisions you are making.

00:04:59.995 --> 00:05:03.252
Some human resources actions such as classification,

00:05:03.235 --> 00:05:07.225
pay, staffing may involve exercising authorities

00:05:07.204 --> 00:05:09.504
from multiple areas.

00:05:18.564 --> 00:05:19.758
Test your knowledge by

00:05:19.738 --> 00:05:21.738
answering the following questions.

00:05:21.713 --> 00:05:25.525
Select “Submit” when you are done.
