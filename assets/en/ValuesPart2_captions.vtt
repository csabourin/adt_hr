00:00:11.956 --> 00:00:15.216
Values and ethics guide managers in responsible

00:00:15.214 --> 00:00:18.353
decision making and in exercising due diligence

00:00:18.337 --> 00:00:21.633
in their responsibilities and accountabilities.

00:00:21.624 --> 00:00:23.945
The Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector

00:00:23.938 --> 00:00:25.935
and the  Directive on Conflict of Interest,

00:00:25.917 --> 00:00:28.355
issued under the Policy on People Management,

00:00:28.334 --> 00:00:31.535
guide all public servants in their professional duties.

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:33.765
The code and the directive are a condition of

00:00:33.758 --> 00:00:36.521
employment, which means that all employees must

00:00:36.498 --> 00:00:39.278
read and agree to them in order to be employed

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.623
in the public service.

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:44.119
The values and expected behaviours outlined

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.143
in the Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.583
are at the foundation of good management and

00:00:49.577 --> 00:00:52.343
leadership, and they are a key element in

00:00:52.325 --> 00:00:55.671
upholding integrity and respect.

00:00:55.664 --> 00:00:57.980
When considering a values and ethics decision,

00:00:57.981 --> 00:01:00.465
ask yourself these questions.

00:01:00.438 --> 00:01:04.620
Do I have the authority to make this decision?

00:01:04.621 --> 00:01:07.300
Have I considered my options?

00:01:07.298 --> 00:01:10.158
Have I consulted my resources?

00:01:10.126 --> 00:01:12.339
A public servant who acts in a manner that

00:01:12.325 --> 00:01:14.319
violates the Values and Ethics Code for

00:01:14.298 --> 00:01:16.829
the Public Sector or the Directive on

00:01:16.823 --> 00:01:20.428
Conflict of Interest may be subject to disciplinary

00:01:20.407 --> 00:01:22.408
measures, up to and including

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.610
termination of employment.

00:01:24.602 --> 00:01:26.687
In certain circumstances, public servants could

00:01:26.684 --> 00:01:29.237
even be charged under Canada’s Criminal Code

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:31.890
for breaches of conduct.

00:01:31.872 --> 00:01:34.263
In this section you will learn to

00:01:34.262 --> 00:01:37.360
identify key elements involved in values and ethics,

00:01:37.342 --> 00:01:39.753
recognize harassment and violence,

00:01:39.731 --> 00:01:41.346
recognize the steps in the harassment

00:01:41.343 --> 00:01:44.070
and violence complaint process, and

00:01:44.035 --> 00:01:46.853
identify acts of wrongdoing as defined by

00:01:46.841 --> 00:01:49.870
the Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act.

00:01:49.861 --> 00:01:51.111
This section should take you

00:01:51.086 --> 00:01:53.376
approximately 30 minutes to complete.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.786
Respect for people is one value that must be

00:02:02.762 --> 00:02:05.451
emphasized among all others.

00:02:05.438 --> 00:02:08.062
Fostering a safe, healthy work environment,

00:02:08.053 --> 00:02:09.762
including protecting employees from

00:02:09.741 --> 00:02:12.402
harassment and violence, is a key requirement

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.505
of employers (or deputy heads), as outlined in the

00:02:15.498 --> 00:02:17.245
Directive on the Prevention and Resolution

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.461
of Workplace Harassment and Violence and

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.355
the Work Place Harassment and Violence

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.905
Prevention Regulations.

00:02:23.905 --> 00:02:25.691
As a manager you are in a position

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:27.546
 of influence and authority. 

00:02:27.531 --> 00:02:29.991
You have a responsibility to

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.712
explain and guide your staff in acting ethically,

00:02:33.698 --> 00:02:36.032
be a role model to your team, and

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:37.972
apply a values-and-ethics filter

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:41.312
in executing your responsibilities.

00:02:41.293 --> 00:02:43.221
To help you assess whether the behaviour

00:02:43.215 --> 00:02:44.902
(an act, comment or display)

00:02:44.888 --> 00:02:46.742
constitutes harassment and violence,

00:02:46.713 --> 00:02:49.312
ask yourself the following questions.

00:02:49.306 --> 00:02:52.032
Did I experience or witness unwelcome

00:02:52.026 --> 00:02:54.312
or offensive behaviour?

00:02:54.318 --> 00:02:56.891
Did it demean, belittle or cause

00:02:56.878 --> 00:03:00.031
personal humiliation or embarrassment?

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:01.871
For a definition of workplace harassment

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:04.251
and violence and a full list of examples,

00:03:04.237 --> 00:03:06.194
please consult the web page

00:03:06.177 --> 00:03:08.024
Requirements for employers to prevent

00:03:08.016 --> 00:03:09.274
harassment and violence

00:03:09.267 --> 00:03:12.077
in federally regulated workplaces.

00:03:12.061 --> 00:03:14.089
Harassment and violence can be

00:03:14.074 --> 00:03:16.141
one severe incident that has a lasting impact

00:03:16.117 --> 00:03:18.724
on the individual, or it can be a series

00:03:18.707 --> 00:03:21.484
of objectionable actions, conduct or comments

00:03:21.481 --> 00:03:24.414
against a person because of, for example,

00:03:24.393 --> 00:03:29.154
that person’s race, national or ethnic origin,

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.317
religion, age, sexual orientation, gender identity or

00:03:34.325 --> 00:03:37.809
expression, genetic characteristics, disability

00:03:37.781 --> 00:03:40.533
or any of the other prohibited grounds listed in

00:03:40.511 --> 00:03:42.793
the Canadian Human Rights Act.

00:03:42.781 --> 00:03:45.001
 In addition, the United Nations Declaration 

00:03:44.978 --> 00:03:46.811
on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples

00:03:46.798 --> 00:03:49.081
 expands the scope of discrimination 

00:03:49.077 --> 00:03:51.351
to include culture, identity,

00:03:51.332 --> 00:03:54.341
religion, language, health,

00:03:54.325 --> 00:03:56.991
education and community.

00:03:56.983 --> 00:03:59.605
When assessing a situation, consider the severity

00:03:59.601 --> 00:04:02.125
and impropriety of the act, the circumstances

00:04:02.102 --> 00:04:04.675
and context of the situation, and whether

00:04:04.657 --> 00:04:06.441
the behaviour is prohibited under

00:04:06.427 --> 00:04:08.545
the Canadian Human Rights Act.

00:04:15.052 --> 00:04:18.361
A formal process is initiated when an employee

00:04:18.361 --> 00:04:20.401
files a written complaint with the individual

00:04:20.393 --> 00:04:22.681
or unit responsible for managing harassment

00:04:22.663 --> 00:04:25.601
and violence complaints.

00:04:25.593 --> 00:04:27.551
For more information on the formal process,

00:04:27.551 --> 00:04:29.411
please refer to the Work Place Harassment

00:04:29.411 --> 00:04:32.802
and Violence Prevention Regulations.

00:04:32.794 --> 00:04:35.092
Harassment and violence is serious and

00:04:35.082 --> 00:04:36.782
needs to be addressed promptly,

00:04:36.782 --> 00:04:39.882
with sensitivity, competence and discretion.

00:04:39.872 --> 00:04:42.562
The primary goal is to resolve allegations of

00:04:42.553 --> 00:04:45.249
harassment and violence with the least disruption

00:04:45.234 --> 00:04:46.773
to the work environment. 

00:04:46.783 --> 00:04:48.303
To accomplish this, follow 

00:04:48.295 --> 00:04:50.989
the eight steps detailed on this website:

00:04:50.989 --> 00:04:52.383
Resolve a workplace harassment

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:53.919
 and violence complaint.  

00:04:53.916 --> 00:04:55.992
The steps include acknowledging 

00:04:55.995 --> 00:04:58.243
receipt of the complaint and notifying 

00:04:58.226 --> 00:05:01.619
the employee who is the object of the complaint, 

00:05:01.615 --> 00:05:02.979
informing the principle party

00:05:02.968 --> 00:05:05.992
of the resources available to them, making

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.059
every reasonable effort to resolve the occurrence,

00:05:09.054 --> 00:05:11.349
and recording all occurrences of harassment

00:05:11.346 --> 00:05:14.577
and violence that have been reported to you.

00:05:23.072 --> 00:05:25.031
During your career in the public service,

00:05:25.012 --> 00:05:27.071
you may be required to address conflicts of

00:05:27.062 --> 00:05:29.298
interest between your private and professional

00:05:29.292 --> 00:05:31.581
activities outside of work and your official

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.231
duties and responsibilities.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.161
Compliance with the Policy on People Management

00:05:36.151 --> 00:05:38.234
and the Directive on Conflict of Interest

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.511
is a condition of employment. 

00:05:40.504 --> 00:05:42.541
The directive details requirements

00:05:42.531 --> 00:05:44.231
 for public servants to prevent and

00:05:44.212 --> 00:05:46.591
 deal with any real, apparent or

00:05:46.571 --> 00:05:48.417
potential conflict of interest during

00:05:48.381 --> 00:05:51.197
their employment and post-employment.

00:05:51.192 --> 00:05:53.187
In essence, the directive states that all

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.707
public servants must serve the public interest

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.865
by taking all possible steps to prevent and resolve,

00:05:58.854 --> 00:06:01.705
in favour of the public interest, any real, apparent

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.975
or potential conflicts of interest between

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.455
their official responsibilities

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.555
and their private affairs.

00:06:07.541 --> 00:06:09.905
For example, employment outside of the

00:06:09.882 --> 00:06:11.222
public service could be seen 

00:06:11.211 --> 00:06:12.863
as a conflict of interest. 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:14.803
So, if an employee informs you

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.753
that they are self-employed or are considering

00:06:16.741 --> 00:06:19.015
a position outside the federal public service,

00:06:19.002 --> 00:06:22.575
it is your responsibility to ask the employee

00:06:22.555 --> 00:06:24.325
to review the requirements outlined

00:06:24.314 --> 00:06:27.175
in the directive, and  write a report

00:06:27.165 --> 00:06:29.675
to inform the deputy head to determine

00:06:29.675 --> 00:06:31.679
whether the situation could place the employee

00:06:31.654 --> 00:06:35.989
in a real, apparent or potential conflict of interest.

00:06:42.634 --> 00:06:44.935
The Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act

00:06:44.915 --> 00:06:48.728
(PSDPA) establishes a process for public sector

00:06:48.704 --> 00:06:50.488
employees to come forward if they believe

00:06:50.454 --> 00:06:52.548
that wrongdoing has occurred or

00:06:52.515 --> 00:06:55.330
is about to occur in the workplace.

00:06:55.305 --> 00:06:58.500
Wrongdoing is defined under the PSDPA

00:06:58.504 --> 00:07:00.650
as any of the following:

00:07:00.655 --> 00:07:02.514
breaking laws or regulations,

00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:04.895
misusing public funds or assets,

00:07:04.895 --> 00:07:06.734
gross mismanagement,

00:07:06.735 --> 00:07:09.822
an act or omission that endangers the life,

00:07:09.795 --> 00:07:13.665
health and safety of Canadians or the environment,

00:07:13.674 --> 00:07:15.975
a serious breach of the public sector

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:18.932
or organizational code of conduct, or

00:07:18.925 --> 00:07:20.500
directing or counselling a person

00:07:20.495 --> 00:07:22.570
to do any of these things.

00:07:22.555 --> 00:07:24.593
The legislation protects public servants’

00:07:24.575 --> 00:07:26.933
confidentiality when disclosing suspected

00:07:26.915 --> 00:07:28.735
wrongdoing and protects them 

00:07:28.714 --> 00:07:30.735
from possible reprisals. 

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.905
As a manager, you have

00:07:31.894 --> 00:07:33.838
an important role to play in modelling

00:07:33.834 --> 00:07:36.135
values-based leadership and informing

00:07:36.135 --> 00:07:37.858
your employees of their rights and

00:07:37.844 --> 00:07:40.697
options under the PSDPA.

00:07:40.685 --> 00:07:42.477
You may encounter situations where

00:07:42.454 --> 00:07:45.217
employees disclose wrongdoing to you.

00:07:45.194 --> 00:07:47.247
It is your role to receive the disclosure,

00:07:47.225 --> 00:07:49.758
inform your organization’s senior officer

00:07:49.744 --> 00:07:52.638
for internal disclosure, and protect the identity

00:07:52.624 --> 00:07:55.258
of those involved in the disclosure process.

00:07:55.244 --> 00:07:56.908
Employees may also choose to approach

00:07:56.894 --> 00:07:59.878
the senior officer for internal disclosure or the

00:07:59.865 --> 00:08:03.318
Public Sector Integrity Commissioner directly.

00:08:08.804 --> 00:08:11.188
Take what you have learned into real life!

00:08:11.185 --> 00:08:12.408
Your organization will have

00:08:12.404 --> 00:08:14.163
its own ways of doing things.

00:08:14.165 --> 00:08:15.398
Take a time out from the course

00:08:15.384 --> 00:08:17.685
to do several things.

00:08:24.195 --> 00:08:25.704
Test your knowledge by answering

00:08:25.685 --> 00:08:27.584
the following questions.

00:08:27.556 --> 00:08:30.828
Select “Submit” when you are done.
