00:00:00.013 --> 00:00:02.224
Everyone benefits from employment equity,

00:00:02.224 --> 00:00:04.703
diversity and inclusion because they

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.674
ensure that current and potential employees

00:00:07.668 --> 00:00:10.333
have equal opportunity to be hired or

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.907
promoted for their skills and abilities.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.332
They also enhance your organization and

00:00:15.304 --> 00:00:18.207
your team as a whole, because a diverse

00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:20.492
workforce can provide a broader range

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:24.575
of ideas and insights and greater resilience.

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:26.268
In this section you will learn to

00:00:26.271 --> 00:00:28.239
recognize the scope of responsibilities

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:30.500
regarding employment equity, diversity,

00:00:30.478 --> 00:00:33.579
inclusion and accommodation.

00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:35.283
Ultimately, employment equity is

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.134
about removing barriers, and diversity,

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:40.283
equity and inclusion are about embracing

00:00:40.274 --> 00:00:43.194
differences so that employees can perform

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:46.774
effectively and fully contribute to the organization.

00:00:46.777 --> 00:00:48.887
This section should take you

00:00:48.886 --> 00:00:52.499
approximately 20 minutes to complete.

00:00:52.484 --> 00:00:54.539
It is your responsibility as a manager

00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:57.469
to ensure an equal access to opportunities

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:59.283
that is free of discrimination.

00:00:59.264 --> 00:01:02.273
It is also your responsibility to remove

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:04.643
barriers that prevent or hinder full

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.822
and equal participation in employment

00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:08.643
in the core public administration.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.480
Be sure to inform your employees

00:01:11.462 --> 00:01:13.655
of their right to request work-related

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.489
accommodation to address needs and

00:01:15.477 --> 00:01:17.150
limitations that impede their

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.543
ability to do their best work.

00:01:19.542 --> 00:01:21.325
In offering accommodation, there is no

00:01:21.305 --> 00:01:24.156
set formula. While respecting the privacy

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.915
and dignity of employees,

00:01:25.905 --> 00:01:29.486
handle each request on a case-by-case basis.

00:01:29.483 --> 00:01:32.078
Accommodation can take many forms.

00:01:32.075 --> 00:01:33.908
Some examples include

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.210
offering attendant services;

00:01:36.161 --> 00:01:38.683
ensuring technology is accessible;

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.552
providing work-related information

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.662
in accessible format;

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:44.962
offering flexible work arrangements;

00:01:44.962 --> 00:01:47.433
providing a prayer room;

00:01:47.418 --> 00:01:49.203
adapting the workspace;

00:01:49.176 --> 00:01:51.334
adapting training programs to

00:01:51.322 --> 00:01:53.974
the needs of employees.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.873
Your organization has policies and

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.474
procedures that offer guidance in creating

00:01:58.462 --> 00:02:00.843
a workplace that is more equitable,

00:02:00.822 --> 00:02:03.165
diverse and inclusive and assistance

00:02:03.161 --> 00:02:05.875
in removing barriers, to ensure that

00:02:05.861 --> 00:02:08.435
all employees can participate equally

00:02:08.401 --> 00:02:11.503
in the work environment.

00:02:11.496 --> 00:02:12.413
Did you know?

00:02:12.405 --> 00:02:15.413
Systemic racism in Canada is not new.

00:02:15.378 --> 00:02:18.413
It dates back to 1536, if not earlier,

00:02:18.407 --> 00:02:20.830
and still exists today.

00:02:20.817 --> 00:02:23.020
Racism creates workplace barriers for

00:02:23.003 --> 00:02:24.699
Black, Indigenous, and other

00:02:24.695 --> 00:02:26.509
equity-seeking groups.

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:29.189
There is a spectrum of understanding of racism,

00:02:29.181 --> 00:02:31.264
from deniers and skeptics, minimizers

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:33.544
and polarizers to those who see it

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.274
but don’t know what to do about it,

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:36.484
and those who see it

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.313
(perhaps because they are living it)

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.903
and are taking action.

00:02:39.884 --> 00:02:42.213
Every employee has the right to a

00:02:42.203 --> 00:02:45.514
workplace free of racism and discrimination.

00:02:45.502 --> 00:02:47.245
There are recourse measures for those

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.585
who feel that their rights,

00:02:48.574 --> 00:02:49.894
or the rights of others,

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.864
are being infringed upon.

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:53.854
There are those who deny that racism

00:02:53.848 --> 00:02:55.963
exists and who actively work against

00:02:55.938 --> 00:02:58.733
efforts to dismantle racism.

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:00.473
Given that the Employment Equity Act

00:03:00.433 --> 00:03:02.633
is law and The Canadian Charter of Rights

00:03:02.627 --> 00:03:05.212
and Freedoms is part of the Constitution Act,

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:08.823
it is illegal to discriminate based on race.

00:03:08.788 --> 00:03:11.002
In addition, the Canadian Human Rights Act

00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:12.883
specifies all of the prohibited

00:03:12.866 --> 00:03:16.069
grounds of discrimination.

00:03:16.065 --> 00:03:18.559
Identifying, removing and preventing conditions

00:03:18.525 --> 00:03:20.919
of disadvantage faced by racialized groups

00:03:20.904 --> 00:03:23.479
and persons with disabilities is key

00:03:23.464 --> 00:03:26.065
to ensuring an equitable environment where

00:03:26.038 --> 00:03:28.275
individuals have equal access to

00:03:28.258 --> 00:03:31.635
opportunities and services.

00:03:31.638 --> 00:03:33.825
Everyone holds unconscious beliefs about

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:36.065
various social and identity groups,

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:37.592
which stem from our tendency

00:03:37.583 --> 00:03:40.952
to organize social worlds into categories.

00:03:40.933 --> 00:03:43.352
A bias is an attitude or belief, conscious

00:03:43.328 --> 00:03:46.322
or unconscious, positive or negative, about

00:03:46.323 --> 00:03:48.604
something in particular, including groups

00:03:48.592 --> 00:03:51.544
of people, while an unconscious bias

00:03:51.516 --> 00:03:53.474
is an attitude or belief we hold

00:03:53.478 --> 00:03:56.264
but are unaware of.

00:03:56.248 --> 00:03:58.184
The brain has learned to take shortcuts

00:03:58.162 --> 00:04:00.572
based on our own personal experiences.

00:04:00.543 --> 00:04:03.236
Although we may be unaware of it, the brain

00:04:03.221 --> 00:04:05.797
makes generalizations, leading to stereotypes

00:04:05.766 --> 00:04:08.526
of people based on characteristics such as age,

00:04:08.525 --> 00:04:13.568
gender, ethnicity, religion and sexual orientation.

00:04:13.558 --> 00:04:16.438
Biases, both conscious and unconscious,

00:04:16.438 --> 00:04:19.658
affect our attitudes, behaviours and decisions.

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:22.323
Become familiar with your own unconscious biases

00:04:22.314 --> 00:04:24.473
and how these may affect your behaviour

00:04:24.463 --> 00:04:27.333
toward current and potential employees, whether

00:04:27.323 --> 00:04:29.413
regarding staffing processes, accommodation

00:04:29.417 --> 00:04:31.716
requests, performance evaluations

00:04:31.701 --> 00:04:33.886
or other situations.

00:04:33.853 --> 00:04:38.016
Remember, biases are learned and can be unlearned.

00:04:38.014 --> 00:04:40.697
Take what you have learned into real life!

00:04:40.676 --> 00:04:42.017
Your organization will have

00:04:42.018 --> 00:04:44.097
its own ways of doing things.

00:04:44.081 --> 00:04:45.604
Take a time out from the course to

00:04:45.593 --> 00:04:47.774
familiarize yourself with your organization’s

00:04:47.745 --> 00:04:50.364
policies and procedures, as well as the scope

00:04:50.353 --> 00:04:52.444
of possible accommodations, to help you

00:04:52.418 --> 00:04:54.874
address where barriers exist, and to help

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.314
build a more inclusive workplace.

00:04:57.312 --> 00:04:59.474
You should also consider employment equity,

00:04:59.467 --> 00:05:02.114
diversity and inclusion as part of your

00:05:02.087 --> 00:05:04.674
HR planning, to support the organization’s

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.581
employment equity commitments.

00:05:07.564 --> 00:05:08.981
Test your knowledge by answering

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.161
the following questions.

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:13.041
Select “Submit” when you are done.
