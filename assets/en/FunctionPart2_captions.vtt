00:00:11.932 --> 00:00:14.144
Everyone benefits from employment equity,

00:00:14.144 --> 00:00:16.436
diversity and inclusion because they

00:00:16.436 --> 00:00:19.336
ensure that current and potential employees

00:00:19.317 --> 00:00:21.982
have equal opportunity to be hired or

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:24.944
promoted for their skills and abilities.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.124
They also enhance your organization and

00:00:27.114 --> 00:00:29.894
your team as a whole, because a diverse

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.224
workforce can provide a broader range

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:36.295
of ideas and insights and greater resilience.

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:37.988
In this section you will learn to

00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:39.948
recognize the scope of responsibilities

00:00:39.918 --> 00:00:42.190
regarding employment equity, diversity,

00:00:42.158 --> 00:00:45.259
inclusion and accommodation.

00:00:45.226 --> 00:00:46.942
Ultimately, employment equity is

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.794
about removing barriers, and diversity,

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.942
equity and inclusion are about embracing

00:00:51.914 --> 00:00:54.834
differences so that employees can perform

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.282
effectively and fully contribute to the organization.

00:00:59.277 --> 00:01:00.832
This section should take you

00:01:00.815 --> 00:01:04.429
approximately 20 minutes to complete.

00:01:10.013 --> 00:01:12.069
It is your responsibility as a manager

00:01:12.063 --> 00:01:14.772
to ensure an equal access to opportunities

00:01:14.748 --> 00:01:17.301
that is free of discrimination.

00:01:17.293 --> 00:01:19.861
It is also your responsibility to remove

00:01:19.858 --> 00:01:22.242
barriers that prevent or hinder full

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:24.412
and equal participation in employment

00:01:24.396 --> 00:01:27.034
in the core public administration.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.064
Be sure to inform your employees

00:01:29.061 --> 00:01:31.254
of their right to request work-related

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.099
accommodation to address needs and

00:01:33.076 --> 00:01:34.510
limitations that impede their

00:01:34.489 --> 00:01:36.893
ability to do their best work.

00:01:36.871 --> 00:01:38.213
In offering accommodation, 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.143
there is no set formula.

00:01:40.135 --> 00:01:41.703
While respecting the privacy

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.650
and dignity of employees,

00:01:43.635 --> 00:01:46.826
handle each request on a case-by-case basis.

00:01:46.813 --> 00:01:49.406
Accommodation can take many forms.

00:01:49.395 --> 00:01:51.586
Some examples include

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.596
offering attendant services;

00:01:53.591 --> 00:01:56.113
ensuring technology is accessible;

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.752
providing work-related information

00:01:57.739 --> 00:01:59.842
in an accessible format;

00:01:59.825 --> 00:02:02.312
offering flexible work arrangements;

00:02:02.301 --> 00:02:05.072
providing a prayer room;

00:02:05.068 --> 00:02:06.853
adapting the workspace;

00:02:06.835 --> 00:02:08.909
adapting training programs to

00:02:08.881 --> 00:02:11.533
the needs of employees.

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:13.432
Your organization has policies and

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:16.014
procedures that offer guidance in creating

00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:18.121
a workplace that is more equitable,

00:02:18.111 --> 00:02:20.914
diverse and inclusive and assistance

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.364
in removing barriers, to ensure that

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.754
all employees can participate equally

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.832
in the work environment.

00:02:34.496 --> 00:02:35.413
Did you know?

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:38.413
Systemic racism in Canada is not new.

00:02:38.377 --> 00:02:41.413
It dates back to 1536, if not earlier,

00:02:41.407 --> 00:02:43.830
and still exists today.

00:02:43.817 --> 00:02:46.020
Racism creates workplace barriers for

00:02:46.002 --> 00:02:47.729
Black, Indigenous, and other

00:02:47.724 --> 00:02:49.759
equity-seeking groups.

00:02:49.748 --> 00:02:52.219
There is a spectrum of understanding of racism,

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.293
from deniers and skeptics, minimizers

00:02:54.288 --> 00:02:56.573
and polarizers to those who see it

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:58.274
but don’t know what to do about it,

00:02:58.258 --> 00:02:59.484
and those who see it

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:01.312
(perhaps because they are living it)

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.369
and are taking action.

00:03:03.353 --> 00:03:05.393
Every employee has the right to a

00:03:05.383 --> 00:03:08.694
workplace free of racism and discrimination.

00:03:08.661 --> 00:03:10.404
There are recourse measures for those

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.735
who feel that their rights,

00:03:11.734 --> 00:03:13.054
or the rights of others,

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.797
are being infringed upon.

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:16.824
There are those who deny that racism

00:03:16.818 --> 00:03:18.933
exists and who actively work against

00:03:18.927 --> 00:03:21.722
efforts to dismantle racism.

00:03:21.718 --> 00:03:23.473
Given that the Employment Equity Act

00:03:23.432 --> 00:03:25.633
is law and The Canadian Charter of Rights

00:03:25.627 --> 00:03:28.211
and Freedoms is part of the Constitution Act,

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:31.823
it is illegal to discriminate based on race.

00:03:31.788 --> 00:03:34.020
In addition, the Canadian Human Rights Act

00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:35.890
specifies all of the prohibited

00:03:35.866 --> 00:03:37.830
grounds of discrimination.

00:03:44.805 --> 00:03:47.299
Identifying, removing and preventing conditions

00:03:47.284 --> 00:03:49.679
of disadvantage faced by racialized groups

00:03:49.663 --> 00:03:52.250
and persons with disabilities is key

00:03:52.243 --> 00:03:54.844
to ensuring an equitable environment where

00:03:54.837 --> 00:03:57.074
individuals have equal access to

00:03:57.078 --> 00:04:00.455
opportunities and services.

00:04:06.378 --> 00:04:08.565
Everyone holds unconscious beliefs about

00:04:08.558 --> 00:04:10.641
various social and identity groups,

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:12.371
which stem from our tendency

00:04:12.362 --> 00:04:15.641
to organize social worlds into categories.

00:04:15.622 --> 00:04:18.041
A bias is an attitude or belief, conscious

00:04:18.047 --> 00:04:21.147
or unconscious, positive or negative, about

00:04:21.142 --> 00:04:23.257
something in particular, including groups

00:04:23.242 --> 00:04:26.541
of people, while an unconscious bias

00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:28.473
is an attitude or belief we hold

00:04:28.478 --> 00:04:31.264
but are unaware of.

00:04:31.247 --> 00:04:33.184
The brain has learned to take shortcuts

00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:35.572
based on our own personal experiences.

00:04:35.543 --> 00:04:38.235
Although we may be unaware of it, the brain

00:04:38.221 --> 00:04:40.557
makes generalizations, leading to stereotypes

00:04:40.546 --> 00:04:43.537
of people based on characteristics such as age,

00:04:43.524 --> 00:04:48.567
gender, ethnicity, religion and sexual orientation.

00:04:48.557 --> 00:04:51.130
Biases, both conscious and unconscious,

00:04:51.108 --> 00:04:54.328
affect our attitudes, behaviours and decisions.

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:57.325
Become familiar with your own unconscious biases

00:04:57.314 --> 00:04:59.473
and how these may affect your behaviour

00:04:59.463 --> 00:05:01.975
toward current and potential employees, whether

00:05:01.972 --> 00:05:04.062
regarding staffing processes, accommodation

00:05:04.036 --> 00:05:06.335
requests, performance evaluations

00:05:06.341 --> 00:05:08.861
or other situations.

00:05:08.853 --> 00:05:13.001
Remember, biases are learned and can be unlearned.

00:05:18.894 --> 00:05:21.237
Take what you have learned into real life!

00:05:21.225 --> 00:05:22.567
Your organization will have

00:05:22.567 --> 00:05:24.417
its own ways of doing things.

00:05:24.401 --> 00:05:25.924
Take a time out from the course to

00:05:25.923 --> 00:05:28.103
familiarize yourself with your organization’s

00:05:28.095 --> 00:05:30.837
policies and procedures, as well as the scope

00:05:30.823 --> 00:05:32.956
of possible accommodations, to help you

00:05:32.918 --> 00:05:35.457
address where barriers exist, and to help

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:37.894
build a more inclusive workplace.

00:05:37.891 --> 00:05:40.053
You should also consider employment equity,

00:05:40.036 --> 00:05:42.683
diversity and inclusion as part of your

00:05:42.686 --> 00:05:45.299
HR planning, to support the organization’s

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.191
employment equity commitments.

00:05:55.194 --> 00:05:56.610
Test your knowledge by answering

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.553
the following questions.

00:05:58.548 --> 00:06:02.389
Select “Submit” when you are done.
