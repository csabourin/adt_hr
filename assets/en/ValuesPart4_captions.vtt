00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.373

before or during the election period.

00:00:34.968 --> 00:00:37.002
In your new role as a manager, you are

00:00:36.976 --> 00:00:39.202
responsible for providing advice and guidance

00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:41.396
to your employees regarding non-partisanship

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.268
and political activities, with the support

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.065

In this section you will learn to

00:00:51.545 --> 00:00:54.625
identify what constitutes political activities,

00:00:54.623 --> 00:00:56.738
and recognize when permission from the

00:00:56.711 --> 00:00:58.548
Public Service Commission is required

00:00:58.527 --> 00:01:01.298
to participate in political activities.

00:01:01.291 --> 00:01:02.518
This section should take you

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:05.429
approximately 10 minutes to complete.

00:01:12.115 --> 00:01:14.426
Non-partisanship is an essential element of a

00:01:14.417 --> 00:01:16.799
professional public service and a responsible

00:01:16.798 --> 00:01:18.813
democratic government. 

00:01:18.793 --> 00:01:20.717
Upholding the non-partisan character 

00:01:20.697 --> 00:01:21.757
of the public service is the

00:01:21.747 --> 00:01:25.486
responsibility of all public service employees.

00:01:25.491 --> 00:01:27.510
According to the Public Service Employment Act

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.827
(PSEA), public service employees can engage

00:01:30.823 --> 00:01:32.864
in political activities if those activities

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:35.188
do not impair, or are not seen to impair,

00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:37.328
their ability to perform their public service

00:01:37.315 --> 00:01:40.103
duties in a politically impartial manner.

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.989
Political activities can be divided into

00:01:41.972 --> 00:01:45.529
two categories: candidacy (seeking nomination as,

00:01:45.532 --> 00:01:49.915
or to be, a candidate) and non-candidacy.

00:01:49.886 --> 00:01:51.835
Any public servant wishing to seek nomination

00:01:51.832 --> 00:01:54.345
as or to be a candidate in an election

00:01:54.339 --> 00:01:57.107
at the municipal, provincial, territorial, or federal

00:01:57.091 --> 00:01:58.855
level must first request permission

00:01:58.827 --> 00:02:00.898
from the Public Service Commission.

00:02:00.877 --> 00:02:03.305
That permission, if granted, may be subject to

00:02:03.302 --> 00:02:05.405
conditions to address potential risks to

00:02:05.398 --> 00:02:08.166
political impartiality, which may include

00:02:08.162 --> 00:02:11.248
a requirement to take leave without pay.

00:02:11.231 --> 00:02:13.671
If elected at the provincial, territorial or federal

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.128
level, a public service employee would cease

00:02:16.128 --> 00:02:17.676
to be a public servant on the day

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.526
they are declared elected.

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.936
In the case of non-candidacy, which includes

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.590
political activities in support of or in opposition

00:02:24.576 --> 00:02:27.133
to a political party or candidate, permission

00:02:27.113 --> 00:02:31.006
from the Public Service Commission is not required.

00:02:30.992 --> 00:02:33.575
In these instances, public service employees

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.985
are responsible for making informed decisions

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:37.815
about whether the activities could impair

00:02:37.802 --> 00:02:40.475
(or be perceived as impairing) their ability

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.548
to perform their duties in an impartial manner.

00:02:43.553 --> 00:02:45.688
Public servants wishing to engage

00:02:45.682 --> 00:02:47.968
in political activities are encouraged to

00:02:47.955 --> 00:02:50.378
consult their organization’s designated political

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:52.963

at the Public Service Commission.

00:02:59.368 --> 00:03:02.021
Allegations of improper political activity

00:03:01.998 --> 00:03:04.471
against an employee may be investigated

00:03:04.443 --> 00:03:06.632
by the Public Service Commission to determine

00:03:06.628 --> 00:03:09.537
if corrective action is appropriate.

00:03:16.747 --> 00:03:18.782
Take what you have learned into real life!

00:03:18.768 --> 00:03:20.607
Your organization will have 

00:03:20.597 --> 00:03:22.207
its own ways of doing things. 

00:03:22.187 --> 00:03:23.677
Take a time out from the course

00:03:23.657 --> 00:03:25.757

00:03:25.741 --> 00:03:27.612

00:03:34.421 --> 00:03:36.914
if  you or any of your employees are considering

00:03:36.914 --> 00:03:39.084
becoming a candidate in a federal, provincial,

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.004
territorial or municipal election, or
