before or during the election period.

00:00:23.368 --> 00:00:25.402
In your new role as a manager, you are

00:00:25.386 --> 00:00:27.612
responsible for providing advice and guidance

00:00:27.596 --> 00:00:29.822
to your employees regarding non-partisanship

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:32.678

In this section you will learn to

00:00:39.955 --> 00:00:43.035
identify what constitutes political activities ,

00:00:43.033 --> 00:00:45.148
and recognize when permission from the

00:00:45.121 --> 00:00:46.958
Public Service Commission is required

00:00:46.937 --> 00:00:49.708
to participate in political activities.

00:00:49.701 --> 00:00:50.928
This section should take you

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:53.441
approximately 10 minutes to complete.

00:00:54.575 --> 00:00:56.886
Non-partisanship is an essential element of a

00:00:56.887 --> 00:00:59.086
professional public service and a responsible

00:00:59.048 --> 00:01:01.846
democratic government. Upholding the

00:01:01.833 --> 00:01:03.836
non-partisan character of the public service

00:01:03.817 --> 00:01:07.556
is the responsibility of all public service employees.

00:01:07.561 --> 00:01:09.778
According to the Public Service Employment Act

00:01:09.774 --> 00:01:12.868
(PSEA), public service employees can engage

00:01:12.853 --> 00:01:15.058
in political activities if those activities

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:17.378
do not impair, or are not seen to impair,

00:01:17.361 --> 00:01:19.528
their ability to perform their public service

00:01:19.525 --> 00:01:22.289
duties in a politically impartial manner.

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:24.199
Political activities can be divided into

00:01:24.192 --> 00:01:27.749
two categories: candidacy (seeking nomination as,

00:01:27.742 --> 00:01:32.125
or to be, a candidate) and non-candidacy.

00:01:32.106 --> 00:01:34.055
Any public servant wishing to seek nomination

00:01:34.042 --> 00:01:36.555
as or to be a candidate in an election

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:39.275

00:01:39.281 --> 00:01:41.045
level must first request permission

00:01:41.027 --> 00:01:43.265
from the Public Service Commission.

00:01:43.257 --> 00:01:45.685
That permission, if granted, may be subject to

00:01:45.682 --> 00:01:47.785
conditions to address potential risks to

00:01:47.768 --> 00:01:50.525
political impartiality, which may include

00:01:50.522 --> 00:01:53.591
a requirement to take leave without pay.

00:01:53.591 --> 00:01:56.031
If elected at the provincial, territorial or federal

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.373
level, a public service employee would cease

00:01:58.358 --> 00:01:59.906
to be a public servant on the day

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.756
they are declared elected.

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:04.166
In the case of non-candidacy, which includes

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.966
political activities in support of or in opposition

00:02:06.966 --> 00:02:09.496
to a political party or candidate, permission

00:02:09.473 --> 00:02:13.366
from the Public Service Commission not required.

00:02:13.352 --> 00:02:15.935
In these instances, public service employees

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.325
are responsible for making informed decisions

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.165
about whether the activities could impair

00:02:20.162 --> 00:02:22.835
(or be perceived as impairing) their ability

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.898
to perform their duties in an impartial manner.

00:02:25.883 --> 00:02:28.018
Public servants wishing to engage

00:02:27.982 --> 00:02:30.268
in political activities are encouraged to

00:02:30.265 --> 00:02:32.688
consult their organization’s designated political

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:35.452

at the Public Service Commission.

00:02:41.518 --> 00:02:44.171
Allegations of improper political activity

00:02:44.148 --> 00:02:46.621
against an employee may be investigated

00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:48.772
by the Public Service Commission to determine

00:02:48.758 --> 00:02:51.667
if corrective action is appropriate.

00:02:52.537 --> 00:02:54.557
Take what you have learned into real life!

00:02:54.548 --> 00:02:57.367
Your organization will have its own ways

00:02:57.347 --> 00:02:59.661
of doing things. Take a time out from the course

00:02:59.627 --> 00:03:02.162
