00:00:10.633 --> 00:00:12.327
Human Resources planning is

00:00:12.295 --> 00:00:14.167
the foundation for assessing and

00:00:14.131 --> 00:00:16.497
understanding the current and future needs

00:00:16.487 --> 00:00:19.013
of government departments, agencies,

00:00:19.011 --> 00:00:21.733
and the public service as a whole.

00:00:21.709 --> 00:00:24.107
Moreover, HR planning is a key

00:00:24.105 --> 00:00:26.597
decision-support tool which allows

00:00:26.593 --> 00:00:29.457
HR staff to act expeditiously and

00:00:29.451 --> 00:00:30.840
in accordance with federal

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.090
public service values.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.886
In this section you will learn to

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.522
recall the functions of HR planning and

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.046
recognize your responsibilities as a manager.

00:00:41.056 --> 00:00:42.252
This section should take you

00:00:42.232 --> 00:00:46.606
approximately 10 minutes to complete.

00:00:52.112 --> 00:00:54.256
Human resources planning is the process

00:00:54.255 --> 00:00:56.414
of identifying current and future

00:00:56.401 --> 00:00:59.055
human resources needs. When we talk

00:00:59.029 --> 00:01:01.338
about HR planning, we are talking about

00:01:01.337 --> 00:01:04.165
how an organization identifies and deploys

00:01:04.157 --> 00:01:06.185
its workforce to achieve its business

00:01:06.177 --> 00:01:08.769
objectives, its mandate, and

00:01:08.748 --> 00:01:11.721
high-level government priorities.

00:01:11.716 --> 00:01:13.282
HR planning ensures that we have a

00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:15.421
well-structured workplace, and can

00:01:15.398 --> 00:01:16.481
secure the right people,

00:01:16.471 --> 00:01:18.621
build a supportive work environment,

00:01:18.614 --> 00:01:20.351
and develop the capacity

00:01:20.341 --> 00:01:23.912
to ensure organizational success.

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:25.742
HR planning can help identify

00:01:25.735 --> 00:01:27.892
optimal strategies and activities

00:01:27.877 --> 00:01:30.512
for a wide variety of important management

00:01:30.506 --> 00:01:34.068
components such as recruitment, retention,

00:01:34.042 --> 00:01:38.508
learning, development, employee engagement,

00:01:38.496 --> 00:01:42.589
talent management, promotion, succession,

00:01:42.586 --> 00:01:46.359
employment equity, and official languages.

00:01:46.346 --> 00:01:49.030
In short, HR planning is essential to the

00:01:49.011 --> 00:01:51.390
continuous improvement of your organization's

00:01:51.372 --> 00:01:55.330
capacity to deliver services to Canadians.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.304
Remember to consult an HR advisor when

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.854
considering the best ways

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.224
to meet your particular business needs.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.495
There are eight functions of effective

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.625
HR planning. Done well,

00:02:06.617 --> 00:02:08.288
it integrates your organization's

00:02:08.266 --> 00:02:10.578
business objectives and reflects business

00:02:10.543 --> 00:02:13.888
needs and strong people management practices.

00:02:13.883 --> 00:02:15.677
It is based on factual and timely

00:02:15.633 --> 00:02:18.707
information about current and future needs

00:02:18.695 --> 00:02:20.827
(for example, environmental scans

00:02:20.805 --> 00:02:22.493
and employee feedback),

00:02:22.483 --> 00:02:25.009
and identifies challenges and key risks

00:02:24.984 --> 00:02:27.149
to delivering on priorities,

00:02:27.124 --> 00:02:29.968
and outlines options for mitigation.

00:02:29.926 --> 00:02:31.978
Effective HR planning should be openly

00:02:31.956 --> 00:02:34.378
communicated and foster open and

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:36.457
transparent dialogue that is inclusive

00:02:36.454 --> 00:02:39.737
and respectful of diverse perspectives.

00:02:39.718 --> 00:02:41.787
Lastly, it establishes processes

00:02:41.785 --> 00:02:44.259
for measuring performance and progress toward

00:02:44.245 --> 00:02:47.319
the objectives and ties into annual reporting,

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.439
succession planning and management.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.069
You might be wondering about your

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.984
specific role in this context.

00:02:54.962 --> 00:02:56.544
With regard to HR planning,

00:02:56.531 --> 00:02:59.254
you have five main responsibilities.

00:02:59.235 --> 00:03:01.769
Identifying the qualifications required

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.719
for individuals in key positions

00:03:03.724 --> 00:03:05.059
to contribute to the success of

00:03:05.054 --> 00:03:07.499
organizational priorities.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.179
Communicating the HR plan with

00:03:09.167 --> 00:03:10.644
critical and emerging gaps

00:03:10.644 --> 00:03:13.214
including succession planning strategies.

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:15.734
Encouraging developmental opportunities

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:17.059
that address gaps.

00:03:17.047 --> 00:03:19.381
Linking succession planning strategies

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:22.371
to program and financial planning and

00:03:22.364 --> 00:03:24.281
evaluating the effectiveness of the plan

00:03:24.277 --> 00:03:28.421
and adapting it as required.

00:03:34.536 --> 00:03:37.131
Take what you have learned into real life!

00:03:37.136 --> 00:03:38.791
Your organization will have

00:03:38.786 --> 00:03:41.031
its own ways of doing things.

00:03:41.031 --> 00:03:43.830
HR planning helps organizations to fulfill

00:03:43.795 --> 00:03:46.489
their mandate. In some organizations,

00:03:46.481 --> 00:03:49.499
an HR plan and the organization's business goals

00:03:49.498 --> 00:03:51.049
will be combined to produce

00:03:51.037 --> 00:03:54.239
an Integrated HR and business plan.

00:03:54.233 --> 00:03:55.837
Take a time out from the course

00:03:55.823 --> 00:03:58.317
to locate your organization's HR plan

00:03:58.306 --> 00:04:00.067
to better understand how it meets

00:04:00.054 --> 00:04:04.387
your business goals and the larger mandate.

00:04:10.264 --> 00:04:12.108
Test your knowledge by answering

00:04:12.084 --> 00:04:13.838
the following questions.

00:04:13.825 --> 00:04:17.509
Select "Submit" when you are done.
