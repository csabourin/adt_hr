00:00:00.013 --> 00:00:01.893
Human Resources planning is

00:00:01.875 --> 00:00:03.683
the foundation for assessing and

00:00:03.661 --> 00:00:05.953
understanding the current and future needs

00:00:05.941 --> 00:00:08.343
of government departments, agencies,

00:00:08.321 --> 00:00:11.043
and the public service as a whole.

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:13.427
Moreover, HR planning is a key

00:00:13.435 --> 00:00:15.927
decision-support tool which allows

00:00:15.913 --> 00:00:18.777
HR staff to act expeditiously and

00:00:18.771 --> 00:00:20.277
in accordance with federal

00:00:20.275 --> 00:00:22.847
public service values.

00:00:22.821 --> 00:00:24.392
In this section you will learn to

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.032
recall the functions of HR planning and

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.432
recognize your responsibilities as a manager.

00:00:30.426 --> 00:00:31.622
This section should take you

00:00:31.622 --> 00:00:35.996
approximately 10 minutes to complete.

00:00:35.972 --> 00:00:38.116
Human resources planning is the process

00:00:38.085 --> 00:00:40.426
of identifying current and future

00:00:40.411 --> 00:00:43.316
human resources needs. When we talk

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.618
about HR planning, we are talking about

00:00:45.617 --> 00:00:48.338
how an organization identifies and deploys

00:00:48.337 --> 00:00:50.498
its workforce to achieve its business

00:00:50.477 --> 00:00:52.928
objectives, its mandate, and

00:00:52.908 --> 00:00:55.881
high-level government priorities.

00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:57.432
HR planning ensures that we have a

00:00:57.441 --> 00:00:59.581
well-structured workplace, and can

00:00:59.568 --> 00:01:00.651
secure the right people,

00:01:00.631 --> 00:01:02.781
build a supportive work environment,

00:01:02.764 --> 00:01:04.501
and develop the capacity

00:01:04.491 --> 00:01:08.062
to ensure organizational success.

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:09.902
HR planning can help identify

00:01:09.865 --> 00:01:12.022
optimal strategies and activities

00:01:12.027 --> 00:01:14.662
for a wide variety of important management

00:01:14.656 --> 00:01:18.218
components such as recruitment, retention,

00:01:18.192 --> 00:01:22.658
learning, development, employee engagement,

00:01:22.646 --> 00:01:26.739
talent management, promotion, succession,

00:01:26.726 --> 00:01:30.499
employment equity, and official languages.

00:01:30.496 --> 00:01:33.180
In short, HR planning is essential to the

00:01:33.171 --> 00:01:35.550
continuous improvement of your organization's

00:01:35.502 --> 00:01:39.520
capacity to deliver services to Canadians.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.464
Remember to consult an HR advisor when

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.034
considering the best ways

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.874
to meet your particular business needs.

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.463
There are eight functions of effective

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.793
HR planning. Done well,

00:01:50.767 --> 00:01:52.553
it integrates your organization's

00:01:52.536 --> 00:01:54.653
business objectives and reflects business

00:01:54.643 --> 00:01:57.557
needs and strong people management practices.

00:01:57.543 --> 00:01:59.937
It is based on factual and timely

00:01:59.913 --> 00:02:03.018
information about current and future needs

00:02:03.015 --> 00:02:04.898
(for example, environmental scans

00:02:04.865 --> 00:02:06.829
and employee feedback),

00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:09.319
and identifies challenges and key risks

00:02:09.314 --> 00:02:11.479
to delivering on priorities,

00:02:11.444 --> 00:02:14.288
and outlines options for mitigation.

00:02:14.276 --> 00:02:16.328
Effective HR planning should be openly

00:02:16.316 --> 00:02:18.738
communicated and foster open and

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:20.787
transparent dialogue that is inclusive

00:02:20.784 --> 00:02:24.067
and respectful of diverse perspectives.

00:02:24.048 --> 00:02:26.117
Lastly, it establishes processes

00:02:26.115 --> 00:02:28.589
for measuring performance and progress toward

00:02:28.585 --> 00:02:31.659
the objectives and ties into annual reporting,

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.779
succession planning and management.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.429
You might be wondering about your

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.354
specific role in this context.

00:02:39.332 --> 00:02:40.914
With regard to HR planning,

00:02:40.901 --> 00:02:43.624
you have five main responsibilities.

00:02:43.605 --> 00:02:46.139
Identifying the qualifications required

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.089
for individuals in key positions

00:02:48.084 --> 00:02:49.419
to contribute to the success of

00:02:49.414 --> 00:02:51.859
organizational priorities.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.519
Communicating the HR plan with

00:02:53.517 --> 00:02:54.994
critical and emerging gaps

00:02:54.974 --> 00:02:57.544
including succession planning strategies.

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.054
Encouraging developmental opportunities

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:01.369
that address gaps.

00:03:01.357 --> 00:03:03.691
Linking succession planning strategies

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:06.651
to program and financial planning and

00:03:06.604 --> 00:03:08.521
evaluating the effectiveness of the plan

00:03:08.527 --> 00:03:12.671
and adapting it as required.

00:03:12.666 --> 00:03:15.261
Take what you have learned into real life!

00:03:15.236 --> 00:03:16.891
Your organization will have

00:03:16.866 --> 00:03:19.111
its own ways of doing things.

00:03:19.101 --> 00:03:21.900
HR planning helps organizations to fulfill

00:03:21.885 --> 00:03:24.579
their mandate. In some organizations,

00:03:24.561 --> 00:03:27.579
an HR plan and the organization's business goals

00:03:27.568 --> 00:03:29.119
will be combined to produce

00:03:29.097 --> 00:03:32.299
an Integrated HR and business plan.

00:03:32.263 --> 00:03:33.867
Take a time out from the course

00:03:33.823 --> 00:03:36.317
to locate your organization's HR plan

00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:38.077
to better understand how it meets

00:03:38.064 --> 00:03:42.397
your business goals and the larger mandate.

00:03:42.384 --> 00:03:44.228
Test your knowledge by answering

00:03:44.214 --> 00:03:45.968
the following questions.

00:03:45.935 --> 00:03:48.099
Select "Submit" when you are done.
