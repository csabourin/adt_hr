00:00:00.013 --> 00:00:03.112
Your organization and classification (or OC)

00:00:03.104 --> 00:00:05.373
responsibilities have an impact on

00:00:05.341 --> 00:00:07.812
every other HR discipline and may also

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.743
have cost implications.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.983
It is therefore important to understand

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.313
how organization and classification work,

00:00:14.304 --> 00:00:17.463
both independently and together.

00:00:17.443 --> 00:00:19.753
Job and position management are common

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.597
responsibilities in this area of HR.

00:00:22.574 --> 00:00:24.128
They are associated with the

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:25.728
Financial Administration Act,

00:00:25.721 --> 00:00:27.288
the Canadian Human Rights Act,

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.797
and several HR policies. We will

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.713
look at all of these in this course.

00:00:32.707 --> 00:00:34.423
In this section, you will learn to

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.792
explain the connection between

00:00:35.792 --> 00:00:37.523
organization and classification;

00:00:37.514 --> 00:00:40.121
recall the manager’s responsibilities

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:42.274
regarding organizational design;

00:00:42.268 --> 00:00:44.118
define the role of specific legislation

00:00:44.106 --> 00:00:46.725
and policies in OC authorities;

00:00:46.707 --> 00:00:48.625
Match organization and classification

00:00:48.615 --> 00:00:50.274
responsibilities to their appropriate

00:00:50.256 --> 00:00:52.600
management level; and recall the roles of

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:56.835
organization and classification in HR management.

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:57.966
This section should take you

00:00:57.957 --> 00:01:03.392
approximately 20 minutes to complete.

00:01:03.378 --> 00:01:06.221
What is Organization and Classification?

00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:08.242
In the core public administration,

00:01:08.245 --> 00:01:10.024
“organization” refers to the alignment

00:01:10.021 --> 00:01:12.093
of a group’s activities with the roles and

00:01:12.078 --> 00:01:14.084
responsibilities mandated by Parliament

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.492
and the government’s priorities. It is

00:01:16.492 --> 00:01:18.534
achieved through a process of review,

00:01:18.516 --> 00:01:20.355
research and modelling that is called

00:01:20.361 --> 00:01:22.912
“organizational design.”

00:01:22.885 --> 00:01:24.825
“Classification” is the process of determining

00:01:24.816 --> 00:01:27.284
the relative value of work at each occupational

00:01:27.257 --> 00:01:29.966
group and level. It is the basis for the

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.084
compensation of all public service employees.

00:01:33.061 --> 00:01:35.134
Positions are classified by analyzing

00:01:35.131 --> 00:01:37.793
the organizational context, job evaluation

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.575
standard, and relativity of a job description, in

00:01:40.557 --> 00:01:43.754
accordance with Treasury Board policy instruments.

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:46.382
Classification underpins coherent organizational

00:01:46.358 --> 00:01:48.441
structures and work relationships.

00:01:48.426 --> 00:01:51.283
It also forms the framework for effective resourcing,

00:01:51.274 --> 00:01:54.072
labour relations, training, performance

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.894
management, and effective management,

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.829
planning and use of human resources

00:01:57.813 --> 00:02:00.513
within an organization.

00:02:00.492 --> 00:02:01.843
Organization and classification

00:02:01.831 --> 00:02:04.328
decisions go hand in hand.

00:02:04.331 --> 00:02:06.510
The structure of the organization is designed

00:02:06.492 --> 00:02:08.729
with the assistance of an HR advisor,

00:02:08.734 --> 00:02:10.120
who also helps define the duties

00:02:10.114 --> 00:02:12.848
to be performed in achieving the mandate.

00:02:12.836 --> 00:02:14.360
Based on the duties of a position

00:02:14.346 --> 00:02:17.098
(or job), the HR advisor or classification

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.519
evaluation committee determines the group

00:02:19.508 --> 00:02:21.459
and level of the positions within an

00:02:21.437 --> 00:02:24.019
organization’s structure. Rates of pay

00:02:24.014 --> 00:02:26.407
are then matched to each occupational group

00:02:26.407 --> 00:02:28.698
and level, and employees are paid based

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.228
on the group and level of the position they occupy.

00:02:32.221 --> 00:02:34.728
Pay and benefits are negotiated outside

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:35.883
of classification through the

00:02:35.871 --> 00:02:38.554
collective bargaining process.

00:02:40.441 --> 00:02:41.461
As previously mentioned,

00:02:41.442 --> 00:02:43.804
organizational design is a formal process for

00:02:43.776 --> 00:02:45.697
developing an organizational structure

00:02:45.693 --> 00:02:48.537
based on its mandate, business objectives,

00:02:48.512 --> 00:02:51.806
budget, resources, etc.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.145
There are different types of organizational

00:02:54.145 --> 00:02:56.349
structures; in the core public administration,

00:02:56.342 --> 00:02:59.819
most are hierarchical. Hierarchical structures

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.471
can be organized according to different

00:03:01.444 --> 00:03:04.121
models: centralized versus decentralized;

00:03:04.097 --> 00:03:07.151
functional versus program oriented.

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:09.721
In consultation with an HR advisor, you will design

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:13.509
an optimal structure such as the ones shown here.

00:03:13.502 --> 00:03:15.783
Eventually, each box will be assigned

00:03:15.756 --> 00:03:17.813
a group and level and will reflect

00:03:17.805 --> 00:03:19.615
the name of the incumbent.

00:03:19.615 --> 00:03:20.557
In the creation and maintenance

00:03:20.544 --> 00:03:23.329
of an organizational structure, accountabilities,

00:03:23.294 --> 00:03:25.467
roles and responsibilities are discussed,

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.739
defined and reflected. The work

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.508
associated with each role is then

00:03:29.508 --> 00:03:31.319
defined in a written job description

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.919
and classified accordingly.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.860
Consult with your OC-accredited HR advisor

00:03:36.823 --> 00:03:39.050
to confirm your organizational structure

00:03:39.044 --> 00:03:41.877
and to plan the review or creation of positions

00:03:41.848 --> 00:03:44.381
to meet your operational needs.

00:03:46.513 --> 00:03:48.104
Managers at all levels have

00:03:48.086 --> 00:03:49.795
organization and classification

00:03:49.798 --> 00:03:53.370
responsibilities for their organizational structures.

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:55.812
As outlined in the Policy on People Management,

00:03:55.812 --> 00:03:58.222
deputy heads are responsible for determining

00:03:58.174 --> 00:04:00.465
the department’s organizational structure

00:04:00.461 --> 00:04:04.217
and executive resourcing requirements.

00:04:04.216 --> 00:04:05.995
Managers are responsible for ensuring

00:04:05.956 --> 00:04:08.092
their organizational structure is in line

00:04:08.068 --> 00:04:09.270
with the organization’s mandate

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.610
and business objectives and determining

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.241
the work assigned to a position

00:04:13.235 --> 00:04:16.235
and described in the job description.

00:04:16.213 --> 00:04:18.187
An OC-accredited HR advisor uses

00:04:18.173 --> 00:04:19.706
the organizational structure and

00:04:19.697 --> 00:04:21.427
the job descriptions approved by the

00:04:21.415 --> 00:04:23.389
delegated manager to evaluate and

00:04:23.374 --> 00:04:25.040
render a classification decision

00:04:25.047 --> 00:04:27.297
on the occupational group, subgroup

00:04:27.288 --> 00:04:30.201
if applicable, and level to a position.

00:04:30.197 --> 00:04:31.821
The classification of the position will

00:04:31.783 --> 00:04:33.730
link the rate of pay as well as benefits

00:04:33.716 --> 00:04:36.170
information, enabling the hiring manager

00:04:36.144 --> 00:04:37.810
to ensure that sufficient funds

00:04:37.788 --> 00:04:41.000
are available to staff the position.

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:45.341
Depending on your Departmental Human Resources

00:04:45.326 --> 00:04:47.562
Delegation Instrument, you may also have

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.480
the authority to approve organizational

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.533
structures and job description content,

00:04:51.523 --> 00:04:53.512
including effective dates.

00:04:53.495 --> 00:04:55.396
It is important that you and your HR

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.778
advisors make organization and classification

00:04:57.764 --> 00:04:59.624
decisions that are relevant to your areas

00:04:59.608 --> 00:05:01.843
of responsibility, in accordance with

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.293
the Policy on People Management

00:05:03.283 --> 00:05:05.583
and its related instruments.

00:05:05.583 --> 00:05:08.653
The FAA identifies the Treasury Board

00:05:08.653 --> 00:05:10.343
as the employer and authorizes

00:05:10.343 --> 00:05:12.884
deputy heads to make classification decisions

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.747
or to sub-delegate authority under

00:05:14.733 --> 00:05:18.653
sections 6 and 11. The specific requirement

00:05:18.632 --> 00:05:21.264
pertaining to organization and classification

00:05:21.254 --> 00:05:24.607
is detailed in various policy instruments.

00:05:24.588 --> 00:05:26.766
The Policy on People Management provides

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.786
deputy heads with the parameters

00:05:28.754 --> 00:05:30.447
to manage their classification authorities

00:05:30.427 --> 00:05:32.968
within their areas of jurisdiction.

00:05:32.963 --> 00:05:35.208
This policy authorizes deputy heads

00:05:35.194 --> 00:05:36.968
to delegate classification authority

00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.932
only to persons who are accredited

00:05:38.927 --> 00:05:42.002
in organization design and classification.

00:05:41.985 --> 00:05:43.553
Note that the authority to decide

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.891
and respond to classification grievances

00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:48.860
remains with the deputy head.

00:05:48.838 --> 00:05:50.521
The Canadian Human Rights Act protects

00:05:50.504 --> 00:05:52.540
people in Canada from discrimination

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.680
when they are employed by or receive

00:05:54.663 --> 00:05:56.636
services from the federal government.

00:05:56.634 --> 00:05:58.036
The elements included in the

00:05:58.012 --> 00:06:01.449
job description are aligned with section 11(2),

00:06:01.418 --> 00:06:03.235
which states that there is a requirement

00:06:03.218 --> 00:06:05.372
for employees under federal jurisdiction

00:06:05.334 --> 00:06:08.672
to consider skill, effort, responsibility

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.471
and working conditions in assessing

00:06:10.447 --> 00:06:13.651
the value of work performed.

00:06:13.632 --> 00:06:15.653
The Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat

00:06:15.641 --> 00:06:17.944
is responsible for all terms and conditions

00:06:17.944 --> 00:06:21.134
of employment, collective bargaining negotiations,

00:06:21.115 --> 00:06:23.838
collective agreements and rates of pay

00:06:23.834 --> 00:06:26.168
within the core public administration.

00:06:26.158 --> 00:06:27.377
For more information, consult the

00:06:27.377 --> 00:06:29.672
Directive on Terms and Conditions of Employment

00:06:29.656 --> 00:06:31.911
and the Directive on Classification,

00:06:31.903 --> 00:06:34.990
which can also be found in the toolbox.

00:06:34.987 --> 00:06:37.110
As mentioned, most organizations have

00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:39.651
an HR delegation instrument that indicates

00:06:39.644 --> 00:06:41.838
to whom organization and classification

00:06:41.821 --> 00:06:44.754
authorities and responsibilities are sub-delegated.

00:06:44.737 --> 00:06:46.874
Some key delegated responsibilities

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:49.500
include approving organizational structures,

00:06:49.495 --> 00:06:52.113
job descriptions, effective dates, classification

00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:54.778
actions or requests, as well as

00:06:54.776 --> 00:06:57.949
rendering classification decisions.

00:07:00.206 --> 00:07:01.848
To get a better understanding of the

00:07:01.829 --> 00:07:04.011
role of organization and classification

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:07.103
within HR management, picture a seven-level

00:07:07.084 --> 00:07:08.952
pyramid representing the sequence

00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:11.642
in which the organization operates.

00:07:11.637 --> 00:07:14.473
The organization needs a mandate and a budget.

00:07:14.468 --> 00:07:16.290
Mandates are found in the acts,

00:07:16.286 --> 00:07:20.261
regulations and charters governing the organization.

00:07:20.244 --> 00:07:22.036
A budget forecast is used to construct

00:07:22.014 --> 00:07:24.507
a model of how the organization might perform

00:07:24.475 --> 00:07:26.798
financially if certain strategies, events

00:07:26.776 --> 00:07:30.548
and plans are carried out to meet the mandates.

00:07:30.543 --> 00:07:32.646
Duties and responsibilities are divided

00:07:32.627 --> 00:07:34.576
among the positions within an organizational

00:07:34.564 --> 00:07:37.221
structure. An organizational chart

00:07:37.208 --> 00:07:39.456
reveals the structure as well as the roles,

00:07:39.461 --> 00:07:41.300
responsibilities and relationships

00:07:41.286 --> 00:07:43.403
between positions within the organization.

00:07:43.398 --> 00:07:45.499
Managers should consult an experienced

00:07:45.485 --> 00:07:47.730
HR advisor to receive valuable advice

00:07:47.718 --> 00:07:49.572
on possible design options and their

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:52.812
impact on the classification of positions.

00:07:52.803 --> 00:07:54.572
All data relevant to a position is

00:07:54.574 --> 00:07:57.137
collected. Normally, the collection

00:07:57.125 --> 00:07:59.067
and organization of information is the

00:07:59.045 --> 00:08:01.319
manager’s responsibility, but it is

00:08:01.302 --> 00:08:03.769
always necessary to consult an HR advisor

00:08:03.762 --> 00:08:06.355
for a job analysis. The end result

00:08:06.339 --> 00:08:08.346
of the analysis is a job description that

00:08:08.341 --> 00:08:11.805
aligns with the mandate of your organization.

00:08:11.803 --> 00:08:13.875
Jobs are evaluated to determine their

00:08:13.872 --> 00:08:17.084
relative value in relation to other positions.

00:08:17.074 --> 00:08:18.608
This function is performed by an

00:08:18.584 --> 00:08:20.499
accredited HR advisor or by

00:08:20.497 --> 00:08:24.189
a classification evaluation committee.

00:08:24.178 --> 00:08:26.521
Salary and benefits (including pensions)

00:08:26.504 --> 00:08:28.242
are determined for particular groups

00:08:28.235 --> 00:08:30.951
of positions. Once the group, subgroups
