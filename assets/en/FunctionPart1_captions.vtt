00:00:11.836 --> 00:00:14.705
Your organization and classification (or OC)

00:00:14.692 --> 00:00:16.963
responsibilities have an impact on

00:00:16.951 --> 00:00:19.422
every other HR discipline and may also

00:00:19.408 --> 00:00:21.352
have cost implications.

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:23.571
It is therefore important to understand

00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:25.893
how organization and classification work,

00:00:25.864 --> 00:00:29.443
both independently and together.

00:00:29.413 --> 00:00:31.312
Job and position management are common

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.167
responsibilities in this area of HR.

00:00:34.162 --> 00:00:35.716
They are associated with the

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:37.298
Financial Administration Act,

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.847
the Canadian Human Rights Act,

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:41.064
and several HR policies. 

00:00:41.064 --> 00:00:44.624
We will look at all of these in this course.

00:00:44.624 --> 00:00:45.942
In this section, you will learn to

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:47.310
explain the connection between

00:00:47.301 --> 00:00:49.656
organization and classification;

00:00:49.656 --> 00:00:51.631
recall the manager’s responsibilities

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:53.774
regarding organizational design;

00:00:53.777 --> 00:00:55.628
define the role of specific legislation

00:00:55.615 --> 00:00:58.234
and policies in OC authorities;

00:00:58.216 --> 00:01:00.134
match organization and classification

00:01:00.115 --> 00:01:01.774
responsibilities to their appropriate

00:01:01.756 --> 00:01:04.099
management level; and recall the roles of

00:01:04.084 --> 00:01:08.334
organization and classification in HR management.

00:01:08.328 --> 00:01:09.465
This section should take you

00:01:09.456 --> 00:01:13.632
approximately 20 minutes to complete.

00:01:18.337 --> 00:01:21.391
What is Organization and Classification?

00:01:21.379 --> 00:01:23.272
In the core public administration,

00:01:23.245 --> 00:01:25.024
“organization” refers to the alignment

00:01:25.021 --> 00:01:27.093
of a group’s activities with the roles and

00:01:27.078 --> 00:01:29.117
responsibilities mandated by Parliament

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.023
and the government’s priorities. 

00:01:31.023 --> 00:01:33.534
It is achieved through a process of review,

00:01:33.516 --> 00:01:35.355
research and modelling that is called

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:37.912
“organizational design.”

00:01:37.885 --> 00:01:39.825
“Classification” is the process of determining

00:01:39.816 --> 00:01:41.298
the relative value of work at 

00:01:41.283 --> 00:01:43.738
each occupational group and level.

00:01:43.728 --> 00:01:45.598
It is the basis for the compensation 

00:01:45.588 --> 00:01:48.084
of all public service employees.

00:01:48.061 --> 00:01:50.134
Positions are classified by analyzing

00:01:50.131 --> 00:01:52.793
the organizational context, job evaluation

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.564
standard, and relativity of a job description, in

00:01:55.555 --> 00:01:58.751
accordance with Treasury Board policy instruments.

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:01.382
Classification underpins coherent organizational

00:02:01.367 --> 00:02:03.450
structures and work relationships.

00:02:03.415 --> 00:02:06.272
It also forms the framework for effective resourcing,

00:02:06.263 --> 00:02:08.562
labour relations, training, performance

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.883
management, and effective management,

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.830
planning and use of human resources

00:02:12.812 --> 00:02:15.513
within an organization.

00:02:15.491 --> 00:02:16.842
Organization and classification

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.328
decisions go hand in hand.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.508
The structure of the organization is designed

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.770
with the assistance of an HR advisor,

00:02:23.734 --> 00:02:25.120
who also helps define the duties

00:02:25.114 --> 00:02:27.848
to be performed in achieving the mandate.

00:02:27.836 --> 00:02:29.360
Based on the duties of a position

00:02:29.346 --> 00:02:32.098
(or job), the HR advisor or classification

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.519
evaluation committee determines the group

00:02:34.507 --> 00:02:36.459
and level of the positions within an

00:02:36.437 --> 00:02:38.540
organization’s structure. 

00:02:38.527 --> 00:02:40.050
Rates of pay are then matched

00:02:40.034 --> 00:02:41.990
 to each occupational group and level,

00:02:41.976 --> 00:02:43.710
 and employees are paid based

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.228
on the group and level of the position they occupy.

00:02:47.221 --> 00:02:49.728
Pay and benefits are negotiated outside

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:50.883
of classification through the

00:02:50.871 --> 00:02:53.554
collective bargaining process.

00:02:59.683 --> 00:03:01.044
As previously mentioned,

00:03:01.012 --> 00:03:03.372
organizational design is a formal process for

00:03:03.376 --> 00:03:05.295
developing an organizational structure

00:03:05.282 --> 00:03:08.127
based on its mandate, business objectives,

00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:11.414
budget, resources, etc.

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:13.492
There are different types of organizational

00:03:13.484 --> 00:03:15.687
structures; in the core public administration,

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:18.072
most are hierarchical. 

00:03:18.056 --> 00:03:20.062
Hierarchical structures can be organized 

00:03:20.072 --> 00:03:21.872
according to different models: 

00:03:21.872 --> 00:03:23.759
centralized versus decentralized;

00:03:23.757 --> 00:03:26.460
functional versus program oriented.

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.389
In consultation with an HR advisor, you will design

00:03:29.378 --> 00:03:33.188
an optimal structure such as the ones shown here.

00:03:33.181 --> 00:03:35.462
Eventually, each box will be assigned

00:03:35.455 --> 00:03:37.513
a group and level and will reflect

00:03:37.495 --> 00:03:39.305
the name of the incumbent.

00:03:39.294 --> 00:03:40.236
In the creation and maintenance

00:03:40.212 --> 00:03:42.998
of an organizational structure, accountabilities,

00:03:42.983 --> 00:03:45.156
roles and responsibilities are discussed,

00:03:45.127 --> 00:03:47.006
defined and reflected. 

00:03:46.997 --> 00:03:48.956
The work associated with each role is then

00:03:48.936 --> 00:03:50.989
defined in a written job description

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:53.598
and classified accordingly.

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.539
Consult with your OC-accredited HR advisor

00:03:56.543 --> 00:03:58.770
to confirm your organizational structure

00:03:58.763 --> 00:04:01.597
and to plan the review or creation of positions

00:04:01.578 --> 00:04:04.110
to meet your operational needs.

00:04:11.513 --> 00:04:13.104
Managers at all levels have

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:14.816
organization and classification

00:04:14.798 --> 00:04:18.370
responsibilities for their organizational structures.

00:04:18.358 --> 00:04:20.812
As outlined in the Policy on People Management,

00:04:20.812 --> 00:04:23.221
deputy heads are responsible for determining

00:04:23.173 --> 00:04:25.463
the department’s organizational structure

00:04:25.461 --> 00:04:29.262
and executive resourcing requirements.

00:04:29.216 --> 00:04:30.995
Managers are responsible for ensuring

00:04:30.956 --> 00:04:33.091
their organizational structure is in line

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:34.271
with the organization’s mandate

00:04:34.237 --> 00:04:36.610
and business objectives and determining

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.240
the work assigned to a position

00:04:38.235 --> 00:04:41.235
and described in the job description.

00:04:41.213 --> 00:04:43.187
An OC-accredited HR advisor uses

00:04:43.173 --> 00:04:44.706
the organizational structure and

00:04:44.697 --> 00:04:46.427
the job descriptions approved by the

00:04:46.415 --> 00:04:48.389
delegated manager to evaluate and

00:04:48.374 --> 00:04:50.053
render a classification decision

00:04:50.047 --> 00:04:52.297
on the occupational group, subgroup

00:04:52.288 --> 00:04:55.201
if applicable, and level to a position.

00:04:55.197 --> 00:04:56.821
The classification of the position will

00:04:56.783 --> 00:04:58.730
link the rate of pay as well as benefits

00:04:58.716 --> 00:05:01.170
information, enabling the hiring manager

00:05:01.144 --> 00:05:02.810
to ensure that sufficient funds

00:05:02.788 --> 00:05:06.000
are available to staff the position.

00:05:11.012 --> 00:05:13.071
Depending on your Departmental Human Resources

00:05:13.045 --> 00:05:15.306
Delegation Instrument, you may also have

00:05:15.288 --> 00:05:17.209
the authority to approve organizational

00:05:17.209 --> 00:05:19.262
structures and job description content,

00:05:19.252 --> 00:05:21.240
including effective dates.

00:05:21.233 --> 00:05:23.134
It is important that you and your HR

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.517
advisors make organization and classification

00:05:25.524 --> 00:05:27.547
decisions that are relevant to your areas

00:05:27.528 --> 00:05:29.762
of responsibility, in accordance with

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.096
the Policy on People Management

00:05:31.103 --> 00:05:33.297
and its related instruments.

00:05:33.281 --> 00:05:36.516
The FAA identifies the Treasury Board

00:05:36.512 --> 00:05:39.124
as the employer and authorizes deputy heads 

00:05:39.123 --> 00:05:41.764
to make classification decisions or to sub-delegate

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:44.976
 authority under sections 6 and 11. 

00:05:44.951 --> 00:05:46.916
The specific requirement pertaining 

00:05:46.901 --> 00:05:49.076
to organization and classification

00:05:49.074 --> 00:05:52.425
is detailed in various policy instruments.

00:05:52.418 --> 00:05:54.617
The Policy on People Management provides

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.636
deputy heads with the parameters

00:05:56.634 --> 00:05:58.326
to manage their classification authorities

00:05:58.307 --> 00:06:00.848
within their areas of jurisdiction.

00:06:00.841 --> 00:06:03.086
This policy authorizes deputy heads

00:06:03.074 --> 00:06:04.848
to delegate classification authority

00:06:04.838 --> 00:06:06.812
only to persons who are accredited

00:06:06.786 --> 00:06:09.862
in organization design and classification.

00:06:09.855 --> 00:06:11.514
Note that the authority to decide

00:06:11.488 --> 00:06:13.829
and respond to classification grievances

00:06:13.807 --> 00:06:16.779
remains with the deputy head.

00:06:16.757 --> 00:06:18.440
The Canadian Human Rights Act protects

00:06:18.434 --> 00:06:20.470
people in Canada from discrimination

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:22.589
when they are employed by or receive

00:06:22.572 --> 00:06:24.545
services from the federal government.

00:06:24.523 --> 00:06:25.925
The elements included in the

00:06:25.911 --> 00:06:29.200
job description are aligned with section 11(2),

00:06:29.187 --> 00:06:31.168
which states that there is a requirement

00:06:31.137 --> 00:06:33.367
for employees under federal jurisdiction

00:06:33.343 --> 00:06:36.706
to consider skill, effort, responsibility

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.447
and working conditions in assessing

00:06:38.427 --> 00:06:41.630
the value of work performed.

00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:43.622
The Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.913
is responsible for all terms and conditions

00:06:45.884 --> 00:06:49.074
of employment, collective bargaining negotiations,

00:06:49.055 --> 00:06:51.778
collective agreements and rates of pay

00:06:51.752 --> 00:06:54.086
within the core public administration.

00:06:54.067 --> 00:06:55.286
For more information, consult the

00:06:55.286 --> 00:06:57.704
Directive on Terms and Conditions of Employment

00:06:57.699 --> 00:06:59.699
and the Directive on Classification,

00:06:59.673 --> 00:07:02.759
which can also be found in the toolbox.

00:07:02.757 --> 00:07:04.879
As mentioned, most organizations have

00:07:04.865 --> 00:07:07.492
an HR delegation instrument that indicates

00:07:07.492 --> 00:07:09.687
to whom organization and classification

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.612
authorities and responsibilities are sub-delegated.

00:07:12.596 --> 00:07:14.733
Some key delegated responsibilities

00:07:14.728 --> 00:07:17.348
include approving organizational structures,

00:07:17.334 --> 00:07:19.951
job descriptions, effective dates, classification

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:22.627
actions or requests, as well as

00:07:22.605 --> 00:07:25.778
rendering classification decisions.

00:07:30.776 --> 00:07:32.418
To get a better understanding of the

00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:34.581
role of organization and classification

00:07:34.559 --> 00:07:37.653
within HR management, picture a seven-level

00:07:37.632 --> 00:07:39.534
pyramid representing the sequence

00:07:39.509 --> 00:07:42.192
in which the organization operates.

00:07:42.175 --> 00:07:45.012
The organization needs a mandate and a budget.

00:07:44.997 --> 00:07:46.819
Mandates are found in the acts,

00:07:46.805 --> 00:07:50.781
regulations and charters governing the organization.

00:07:50.764 --> 00:07:52.555
A budget forecast is used to construct

00:07:52.533 --> 00:07:54.863
a model of how the organization might perform

00:07:54.865 --> 00:07:57.187
financially if certain strategies, events

00:07:57.165 --> 00:08:00.937
and plans are carried out to meet the mandates.

00:08:00.923 --> 00:08:03.026
Duties and responsibilities are divided among 

00:08:02.997 --> 00:08:05.828
the positions within an organizational structure. 

00:08:05.824 --> 00:08:08.001
An organizational chart reveals 

00:08:07.978 --> 00:08:09.381
the structure as well as the roles,

00:08:09.371 --> 00:08:11.680
responsibilities and relationships

00:08:11.675 --> 00:08:14.387
between positions within the organization.

00:08:14.377 --> 00:08:16.187
Managers should consult an experienced

00:08:16.175 --> 00:08:18.420
HR advisor to receive valuable advice

00:08:18.427 --> 00:08:20.281
on possible design options and their

00:08:20.269 --> 00:08:23.312
impact on the classification of positions.

00:08:23.281 --> 00:08:26.522
All data relevant to a position is collected. 

00:08:26.512 --> 00:08:27.605
Normally, the collection

00:08:27.584 --> 00:08:29.526
and organization of information is the

00:08:29.514 --> 00:08:31.788
manager’s responsibility, but it is

00:08:31.752 --> 00:08:33.618
always necessary to consult an 

00:08:33.602 --> 00:08:36.328
HR advisor for a job analysis. 

00:08:36.334 --> 00:08:37.908
The end result of the analysis

00:08:37.899 --> 00:08:39.248
 is a job description that

00:08:39.248 --> 00:08:42.669
aligns with the mandate of your organization.

00:08:42.653 --> 00:08:44.543
Jobs are evaluated to determine their

00:08:44.543 --> 00:08:47.754
relative value in relation to other positions.

00:08:47.725 --> 00:08:49.259
This function is performed by an

00:08:49.231 --> 00:08:51.149
accredited HR advisor or by
