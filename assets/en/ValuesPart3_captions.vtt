00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:14.113
The federal government’s official languages

00:00:14.103 --> 00:00:16.953
programs not only ensure that services are delivered

00:00:16.947 --> 00:00:19.853
to Canadians in both English and French,

00:00:19.845 --> 00:00:22.184
they also protect the official language rights

00:00:22.186 --> 00:00:24.482
of all public servants and promote the use of

00:00:24.477 --> 00:00:26.674
both official languages in the workplace

00:00:26.654 --> 00:00:29.556
in bilingual regions.

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:32.094
To accomplish this, the official languages programs

00:00:32.088 --> 00:00:34.224
ensure that organizations comply with the

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.466
requirements of the Official Languages Act

00:00:36.448 --> 00:00:38.436
and the Treasury Board’s official languages

00:00:38.415 --> 00:00:40.235
policy instrument.

00:00:40.226 --> 00:00:42.766
In this section you will learn to

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.756
identify manager and employee responsibilities

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.093
related to official languages and

00:00:48.071 --> 00:00:51.113
recognize responsibilities regarding employee rights

00:00:51.108 --> 00:00:53.203
related to language of work.

00:00:53.175 --> 00:00:54.569
This section should take you

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:57.621
approximately 30 minutes to complete.

00:01:03.557 --> 00:01:05.505
Did you know that the Official Languages Act

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:08.859
is based on the Constitution Act of 1867

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:11.341
and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

00:01:11.326 --> 00:01:13.643
The Act has a quasi-constitutional status

00:01:13.636 --> 00:01:16.773
that is recognized by the Canadian courts.

00:01:16.762 --> 00:01:18.903
The Policy on Official Languages exists

00:01:18.908 --> 00:01:21.533
to facilitate the effective implementation of

00:01:21.521 --> 00:01:24.332
the Official Languages Act and its Official Languages

00:01:24.314 --> 00:01:26.692
(Communications with and Services to the Public)

00:01:26.683 --> 00:01:30.052
Regulations by government institutions.

00:01:30.032 --> 00:01:33.072
The policy sets out the following expected results.

00:01:33.055 --> 00:01:35.001
The public can communicate with

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:37.451
and receive services from federal government

00:01:37.453 --> 00:01:40.291
institutions in English or French.

00:01:40.282 --> 00:01:42.031
Employees can use the official language

00:01:42.023 --> 00:01:44.831
of their choice and work in an environment

00:01:44.821 --> 00:01:46.234
that is conducive to the use of

00:01:46.213 --> 00:01:47.924
both official languages.

00:01:47.906 --> 00:01:49.556
English-speaking and French-speaking

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:52.144
Canadians have equal opportunities for employment

00:01:52.129 --> 00:01:54.134
and advancement in institutions,

00:01:54.111 --> 00:01:56.494
taking into account the institutions’ mandate,

00:01:56.467 --> 00:01:59.008
location, and the public they serve, and

00:01:59.007 --> 00:02:01.265
appropriate governance structures, mechanisms,

00:02:01.262 --> 00:02:03.938
and resources are in place to ensure coherent

00:02:03.918 --> 00:02:05.603
management of the institution’s

00:02:05.583 --> 00:02:08.761
official languages responsibilities.

00:02:15.251 --> 00:02:16.679
Did you know that there is a difference

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.191
between a bilingual region and a

00:02:18.167 --> 00:02:20.599
designated bilingual office?

00:02:20.601 --> 00:02:22.901
Some offices are designated bilingual

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:24.540
for the purpose of communications

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.209
and services to the public even if

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.642
they are located in a unilingual region

00:02:29.636 --> 00:02:31.972
for language-of-work purposes.

00:02:31.974 --> 00:02:33.982
To identify such regions, consult

00:02:33.991 --> 00:02:36.215
the Burolis database.

00:02:36.212 --> 00:02:38.495
So let’s look at how the requirements apply

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:40.260
in bilingual or unilingual offices

00:02:40.241 --> 00:02:42.705
for language-of-work purposes.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.505
The Directive on Official Languages for

00:02:44.493 --> 00:02:46.853
Communications and Services applies to

00:02:46.835 --> 00:02:49.015
all communications involving the public

00:02:48.998 --> 00:02:51.165
or public service employees.

00:02:51.163 --> 00:02:53.523
Regarding communications with and services

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:55.955
to the public, managers of designated

00:02:55.937 --> 00:02:59.723
bilingual offices are responsible for ensuring that:

00:02:59.718 --> 00:03:02.083
communications and services in their offices

00:03:02.078 --> 00:03:04.693
are actively offered in English and French;

00:03:04.683 --> 00:03:06.889
the necessary capacity is in place to

00:03:06.877 --> 00:03:09.469
communicate with and provide services to

00:03:09.456 --> 00:03:12.541
members of the public in both official languages;

00:03:12.548 --> 00:03:14.961
communications with and services to the public

00:03:14.947 --> 00:03:17.250
from a designated office are in both official

00:03:17.227 --> 00:03:19.370
languages or in the preferred language

00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:21.690
of the recipient, if known;

00:03:21.675 --> 00:03:23.701
when a designated office uses the media

00:03:23.697 --> 00:03:25.531
to communicate with the public

00:03:25.518 --> 00:03:27.414
(in circumstances other than those covered

00:03:27.401 --> 00:03:29.924
by section 11 of the Official Languages Act),

00:03:29.914 --> 00:03:32.390
communications to the public are in both official

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.224
languages or in the official language of the media

00:03:35.204 --> 00:03:37.678
to reach its target audience.

00:03:37.651 --> 00:03:39.698
The managerial responsibilities linked

00:03:39.691 --> 00:03:41.775
to your institution’s obligations regarding

00:03:41.747 --> 00:03:43.708
communications with public service employees

00:03:43.698 --> 00:03:45.912
can vary depending on whether your office is

00:03:45.897 --> 00:03:49.871
located in a unilingual region or a bilingual region.

00:03:49.854 --> 00:03:51.831
To find out whether your organization is

00:03:51.825 --> 00:03:53.911
located in a bilingual region,

00:03:53.908 --> 00:03:55.632
you can refer to the List of Bilingual Regions

00:03:55.621 --> 00:03:58.484
of Canada for Language-of-Work Purposes.

00:04:04.842 --> 00:04:06.483
The Directive on Official Languages

00:04:06.472 --> 00:04:08.093
for People Management supports the

00:04:08.092 --> 00:04:10.495
Policy on Official Languages by identifying

00:04:10.487 --> 00:04:13.073
requirements related to

00:04:13.067 --> 00:04:16.005
the linguistic identification of a position,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.805
the staffing of bilingual positions, and

00:04:18.813 --> 00:04:21.360
the equitable participation of English-speaking and

00:04:21.331 --> 00:04:25.080
French-speaking Canadians in federal institutions.

00:04:25.063 --> 00:04:27.180
In bilingual regions, managers and

00:04:27.173 --> 00:04:28.810
supervisors are responsible for:

00:04:28.795 --> 00:04:31.630
providing employees with regularly and widely used

00:04:31.616 --> 00:04:33.454

00:04:50.695 --> 00:04:52.966
to use the official language of their choice

00:04:52.945 --> 00:04:54.736
in meetings, regardless of the

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.255
linguistic identification of their position;

00:04:58.246 --> 00:05:00.855
ensuring that training and professional development

00:05:00.844 --> 00:05:02.743
is available to employees in the

00:05:02.725 --> 00:05:05.205
official language of their choice;

00:05:05.174 --> 00:05:07.425
ensuring that annual performance reviews and

00:05:07.418 --> 00:05:09.771
appraisal ratings reflect compliance with the

00:05:09.761 --> 00:05:11.281

00:05:18.973 --> 00:05:20.892
employees to use the official language

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:22.902
of their choice for both oral and written

00:05:22.887 --> 00:05:25.789
communication purposes.

00:05:25.782 --> 00:05:28.639
Note: Managers and supervisors who occupy

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.439
bilingual positions supervise each employee

00:05:31.431 --> 00:05:33.759
in the language chosen by that employee

00:05:33.751 --> 00:05:36.183
regardless of the linguistic identification

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.939
of the employee's position.

00:05:38.911 --> 00:05:41.805
In unilingual regions (for language-of-work purposes),

00:05:41.785 --> 00:05:45.125
managers and supervisors are responsible for

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.985

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.545
or employees in English and French.

00:05:57.534 --> 00:05:59.837
Using the Leadership Competencies Profile for

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.567
Official Languages can help individuals

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.469
self-assess their level of functionality

00:06:04.461 --> 00:06:06.424
in their second language.

00:06:13.882 --> 00:06:16.259
Managers in various federal organizations

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.642
are responsible for ensuring that the positions

00:06:18.611 --> 00:06:20.469
they manage reflect the level of language

00:06:20.441 --> 00:06:23.004
proficiency required to perform the duties

00:06:22.982 --> 00:06:25.244

00:06:25.235 --> 00:06:28.354
If you are a manager in an institution listed in

00:06:28.354 --> 00:06:32.150
Schedules I or IV of the Financial Administration Act,

00:06:32.095 --> 00:06:34.036

Your organization will have its own ways

00:07:27.407 --> 00:07:29.908
of doing things. Take a time out from the course

00:07:29.907 --> 00:07:32.207
to consult the course tool box for a list of

00:07:32.197 --> 00:07:34.497
