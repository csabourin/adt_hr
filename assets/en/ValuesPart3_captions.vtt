00:00:00.013 --> 00:00:02.303
The federal government’s official languages 

00:00:02.283 --> 00:00:05.293
programs not only ensure that services are delivered 

00:00:05.277 --> 00:00:08.183
to Canadians in both English and French. 

00:00:08.185 --> 00:00:10.524
They also protect the official language rights 

00:00:10.516 --> 00:00:13.074
of all public servants and promote the use of 

00:00:13.057 --> 00:00:15.254
both official languages in the workplace 

00:00:15.244 --> 00:00:17.924
in bilingual regions.  

00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:20.434
To accomplish this, the official languages programs 

00:00:20.428 --> 00:00:22.564
ensure that organizations comply with the

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.006
requirements of the Official Languages Act 

00:00:24.998 --> 00:00:26.986
and the Treasury Board’s official languages 

00:00:26.975 --> 00:00:28.795
policy instruments.

00:00:28.786 --> 00:00:31.326
In this section you will learn to

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.306
identify manager and employee responsibilities 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.653
related to official languages and

00:00:36.621 --> 00:00:39.663
recognize responsibilities regarding employee rights 

00:00:39.658 --> 00:00:41.753
related to language of work.

00:00:41.735 --> 00:00:43.129
This section should take you 

00:00:43.094 --> 00:00:46.161
approximately 30 minutes to complete. 

00:00:47.557 --> 00:00:49.909
Did you know that the Official Languages Act 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.239
is based on the Constitution Act of 1867 

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:55.741
and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 

00:00:55.716 --> 00:00:58.033
The Act has a quasi-constitutional status 

00:00:58.036 --> 00:01:01.173
that is recognized by the Canadian courts. 

00:01:01.162 --> 00:01:03.303
The Policy on Official Languages exists 

00:01:03.268 --> 00:01:05.893
to facilitate the effective implementation of

00:01:05.891 --> 00:01:08.702
the Official Languages Act and its Official Languages 

00:01:08.674 --> 00:01:11.052
(Communications with and Services to the Public) 

00:01:11.043 --> 00:01:14.412
Regulations by government institutions.  

00:01:14.392 --> 00:01:17.432
The policy sets out the following expected results.

00:01:17.405 --> 00:01:19.351
The public can communicate with 

00:01:19.339 --> 00:01:21.791
and receive services from federal government 

00:01:21.763 --> 00:01:24.601
institutions in English or French .

00:01:24.602 --> 00:01:26.351
Employees can use the official language 

00:01:26.343 --> 00:01:29.151
of their choice and work in an environment 

00:01:29.151 --> 00:01:30.564
that is conducive to the use of

00:01:30.543 --> 00:01:32.254
 both official languages.

00:01:32.236 --> 00:01:33.886
English-speaking and French-speaking 

00:01:33.852 --> 00:01:36.454
Canadians have equal opportunities for employment 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:38.434
and advancement in institutions, 

00:01:38.421 --> 00:01:40.804
taking into account the institutions’ mandate, 

00:01:40.787 --> 00:01:43.328
location, and the public they serve, and  

00:01:43.307 --> 00:01:45.560
appropriate governance structures, mechanisms, 

00:01:45.542 --> 00:01:48.218
and resources are in place to ensure coherent

00:01:48.218 --> 00:01:49.903
management of the institution’s 

00:01:49.893 --> 00:01:53.071
official languages responsibilities.

00:01:54.971 --> 00:01:56.653
Did you know that there is a difference 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.151
between a bilingual region and a 

00:01:58.147 --> 00:02:00.803
designated bilingual office?

00:02:00.781 --> 00:02:03.081
Some offices are designated bilingual 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:04.740
for the purpose of communications

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:06.933
 and services to the public even if 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.382
 they are located in a unilingual region 

00:02:09.346 --> 00:02:11.682
for language-of-work purposes. 

00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:13.672
To identify such regions, consult 

00:02:13.671 --> 00:02:15.895
the Burolis database.

00:02:15.882 --> 00:02:18.165
So let’s look at how the requirements apply 

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:19.920
in bilingual or unilingual offices 

00:02:19.901 --> 00:02:22.365
for language-of-work purposes.  

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.165
The Directive on Official Languages for 

00:02:24.143 --> 00:02:26.503
Communications and Services applies to 

00:02:26.495 --> 00:02:28.675
all communications involving the public 

00:02:28.658 --> 00:02:30.825
or public service employees. 

00:02:30.833 --> 00:02:33.555
Regarding communications with and services

00:02:33.536 --> 00:02:35.985
 to the public, managers of designated 

00:02:35.977 --> 00:02:39.283
bilingual offices are responsible for ensuring that:

00:02:39.288 --> 00:02:41.973
communications and services in their offices 

00:02:41.948 --> 00:02:44.773
are actively offered in English and French;

00:02:44.753 --> 00:02:46.942
the necessary capacity is in place to 

00:02:46.937 --> 00:02:49.511
communicate with and provide services to

00:02:49.486 --> 00:02:52.571
 members of the public in both official languages;

00:02:52.548 --> 00:02:54.961
communications with and services to the public  

00:02:54.947 --> 00:02:57.250
from a designated office are in both official

00:02:57.227 --> 00:02:59.370
 languages or in the preferred language 

00:02:59.361 --> 00:03:01.690
of the recipient, if known;

00:03:01.675 --> 00:03:03.701
when a designated office uses the media 

00:03:03.697 --> 00:03:05.531
to communicate with the public 

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:07.414
(in circumstances other than those covered 

00:03:07.401 --> 00:03:09.924
by section 11 of the Official Languages Act), 

00:03:09.914 --> 00:03:12.390
communications to the public are in both official 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:15.224
languages or in the official language of the media 

00:03:15.204 --> 00:03:17.678
to reach its target audience.

00:03:17.651 --> 00:03:19.698
The managerial responsibilities linked 

00:03:19.691 --> 00:03:21.775
to your institution’s obligations regarding 

00:03:21.747 --> 00:03:23.708
communications with public service employees 

00:03:23.698 --> 00:03:25.912
can vary depending on whether your office is

00:03:25.897 --> 00:03:29.871
located in a unilingual region or a bilingual region.

00:03:29.854 --> 00:03:31.831
To find out whether your organization is 

00:03:31.825 --> 00:03:33.911
located in a bilingual region, 

00:03:33.908 --> 00:03:35.632
you can refer to the List of Bilingual Regions 

00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:38.484
of Canada for Language-of-Work Purposes. 

00:03:40.242 --> 00:03:42.187
The Directive on Official Languages 

00:03:42.162 --> 00:03:43.917
for People Management supports the 

00:03:43.912 --> 00:03:46.315
Policy on Official Languages by identifying 

00:03:46.287 --> 00:03:48.725
requirements related to

00:03:48.707 --> 00:03:51.645
the linguistic identification of a position,

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.455
the staffing of bilingual positions, and  

00:03:54.453 --> 00:03:57.000
the equitable participation of English-speaking and 

00:03:57.001 --> 00:04:00.750
French-speaking Canadians in federal institutions.

00:04:00.743 --> 00:04:02.860
In bilingual regions, managers and 

00:04:02.853 --> 00:04:04.490
supervisors are responsible for:

00:04:04.475 --> 00:04:07.310
providing employees with regularly and widely used 

00:04:07.276 --> 00:04:09.114

00:04:09.114 --> 00:04:11.154
in both official languages;

00:04:11.143 --> 00:04:13.314

00:04:15.094 --> 00:04:17.904
bilingual or either/or positions;

00:04:17.891 --> 00:04:20.050

taking all necessary measures to enable employees 

00:04:26.375 --> 00:04:28.646
to use the official language of their choice 

00:04:28.635 --> 00:04:30.426
in meetings, regardless of the 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.965
linguistic identification of their position;

00:04:33.936 --> 00:04:36.545
ensuring that training and professional development 

00:04:36.524 --> 00:04:38.423
is available to employees in the

00:04:38.415 --> 00:04:40.895
official language of their choice;

00:04:40.884 --> 00:04:43.135
ensuring that annual performance reviews and 

00:04:43.118 --> 00:04:45.471
appraisal ratings reflect compliance with the 

00:04:45.461 --> 00:04:46.981
Directive on Official Languages for 

00:04:46.974 --> 00:04:49.211

00:04:49.186 --> 00:04:52.261
the Treasury Board is the employer; and  

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:54.671
maintaining a work environment that allows 

00:04:54.663 --> 00:04:56.582
employees to use the official language 

00:04:56.559 --> 00:04:58.582
of their choice for both oral and written 

00:04:58.567 --> 00:05:01.469
communication purposes.

00:05:01.442 --> 00:05:04.299
Note: Managers and supervisors who occupy 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.089
bilingual positions supervise each employee 

00:05:07.081 --> 00:05:09.409
in the language chosen by that employee 

00:05:09.411 --> 00:05:11.812
regardless of the linguistic identification

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.569
of the employee's position.

00:05:14.531 --> 00:05:17.425
In unilingual regions (for language-of-work purposes), 

00:05:17.415 --> 00:05:20.755
managers and supervisors are responsible for

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.605

in both official languages, if they are required 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.987
to communicate or provide services to the public 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.165
or employees in English and French.

00:05:33.164 --> 00:05:35.467
Using the Leadership Competencies Profile for 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.187
Official Languages can help individuals 

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.089
self-assess their level of functionality 

00:05:40.061 --> 00:05:42.024
in their second language.  

00:05:42.882 --> 00:05:45.259
Managers in various federal organizations 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.642
are responsible for ensuring that the positions 

00:05:47.611 --> 00:05:49.469
they manage reflect the level of language 

00:05:49.441 --> 00:05:52.004
proficiency required to perform the duties 

00:05:51.992 --> 00:05:54.254
and tasks of the positions.

00:05:54.225 --> 00:05:57.344
If you are a manager in an institution listed in 

00:05:57.344 --> 00:06:01.376
Schedules I or IV of the Financial Administration Act, 

00:06:01.365 --> 00:06:03.306
you can identify a language profile <br>

The language of the position is the one chosen

00:06:40.464 --> 00:06:42.317
 by the incumbent for as long as they remain 

00:06:42.294 --> 00:06:45.797
