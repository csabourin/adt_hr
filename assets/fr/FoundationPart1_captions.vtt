00:00:00.013 --> 00:00:02.142
As a manager, you may be asked

00:00:02.125 --> 00:00:04.352
to perform various HR activities

00:00:04.362 --> 00:00:07.142
such as hire a new employee,

00:00:07.121 --> 00:00:09.287
draft a new job description,

00:00:09.282 --> 00:00:10.835
approve leave requests

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.871
and conduct performance reviews.

00:00:12.865 --> 00:00:14.554
But before you do any of these,

00:00:14.544 --> 00:00:15.887
you will need to know if

00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:18.128
you have the authority to do so.

00:00:18.125 --> 00:00:20.422
You may be delegated key authorities

00:00:20.422 --> 00:00:23.707
in human resources, commonly referred to as HR.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.010
To exercise these authorities appropriately,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.925
you need to understand how they are delegated.

00:00:28.917 --> 00:00:30.995
You must also be able to interpret

00:00:30.993 --> 00:00:33.597
your organization's HR delegation instruments

00:00:33.573 --> 00:00:36.408
and use them efficiently and effectively,

00:00:36.415 --> 00:00:37.686
in consultation with the

00:00:37.671 --> 00:00:40.149
appropriate subject matter experts.

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:42.000
In this section you will learn to

00:00:41.987 --> 00:00:43.930
recognize who delegates authority

00:00:43.917 --> 00:00:46.218
and who receives delegation, and

00:00:46.207 --> 00:00:48.658
identify levels of authority required

00:00:48.658 --> 00:00:51.752
to approve specific HR requests.

00:00:51.726 --> 00:00:53.292
This section should take you

00:00:53.281 --> 00:00:57.375
approximately 15 minutes to complete.

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:59.619
Parliament creates authorities through legislation

00:00:59.582 --> 00:01:02.125
and from here deputy heads receive

00:01:02.125 --> 00:01:04.096
certain HR-related authorities directly

00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:07.159
from legislation and regulations, most

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.093
specifically from the Financial Administration Act

00:01:10.076 --> 00:01:13.281
and the Public Service Employment Act.

00:01:13.277 --> 00:01:15.460
In addition, the Public Service Employment Act

00:01:15.456 --> 00:01:17.921
gives the Public Service Commission the authority

00:01:17.902 --> 00:01:19.150
to make appointments to

00:01:19.156 --> 00:01:21.165
and within the public service.

00:01:21.137 --> 00:01:24.186
The Public Service Employment Act also authorizes

00:01:24.177 --> 00:01:25.915
the Public Service Commission to delegate

00:01:25.891 --> 00:01:28.460
appointment and appointment-related authorities

00:01:28.462 --> 00:01:29.960
to deputy heads, for positions

00:01:29.941 --> 00:01:32.359
within the jurisdiction.

00:01:32.361 --> 00:01:35.146
Human resources authorities are divided into

00:01:35.137 --> 00:01:37.025
directly conferred authorities

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.551
and delegated authorities.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.411
Directly conferred authorities are those granted

00:01:42.397 --> 00:01:44.350
directly to deputy heads and

00:01:44.326 --> 00:01:47.661
those granted to the Public Service Commission.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.141
The Public Service Commission may then delegate

00:01:50.135 --> 00:01:53.713
additional authorities to deputy heads.

00:01:53.706 --> 00:01:56.868
An individual may exercise delegated authorities

00:01:56.855 --> 00:01:59.155
once they occupy the position to which authorities <br>

00:01:59.144 --> 00:02:01.444
have been associated, have completed the

00:02:01.444 --> 00:02:03.997
necessary training, and received

00:02:03.994 --> 00:02:07.657
their delegation from the deputy head.

00:02:07.646 --> 00:02:09.771
The Public Service Commission sub-delegates <br>

00:02:09.777 --> 00:02:12.067
most appointments and appointment-related

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.883
authorities to deputy heads, who may then

00:02:14.854 --> 00:02:17.126
sub-delegate the majority of these authorities

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.086
to managers.

00:02:19.085 --> 00:02:21.426
This differs from many other HR-related authorities,

00:02:21.405 --> 00:02:23.916
such as leave authorities, which may be exercised <br>

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.066
by virtue of occupying a position,

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.977
while others require specialized training

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.756
to receive accreditation,

00:02:30.752 --> 00:02:34.216
as is the case for Organization and Classification.

00:02:34.211 --> 00:02:36.853
An individual may exercise sub-delegated authorities

00:02:36.826 --> 00:02:39.175
for staffing once they occupy the position <br>

00:02:39.171 --> 00:02:41.319
to which authorities have been associated,

00:02:41.301 --> 00:02:43.433
have completed the necessary training,

00:02:43.415 --> 00:02:45.884
have received the delegation from the deputy head

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.408
and have signed the attestation.

00:02:48.408 --> 00:02:50.228
In the case of appointment authorities,

00:02:50.225 --> 00:02:51.632
they must be exercised by <br>

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.588
a duly sub-delegated manager.

00:02:53.588 --> 00:02:55.889
Although many people may be involved

00:02:55.878 --> 00:02:57.484
in a selection process,

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.789
the sub-delegated manager remains accountable

00:02:59.777 --> 00:03:02.512
and responsible for all decisions.

00:03:02.507 --> 00:03:04.302
For an overview of delegations,

00:03:04.297 --> 00:03:05.912
take a look at the Appointment Delegation

00:03:05.897 --> 00:03:09.261
and Accountability Instrument and review the types

00:03:09.237 --> 00:03:11.539
of authorities directly conferred to deputy heads,

00:03:11.538 --> 00:03:13.839
as well as those granted to

00:03:13.796 --> 00:03:17.188
the Public Service Commission.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.130
Each organization has its own tools to delegate

00:03:20.108 --> 00:03:22.530
authorities appropriately through managerial

00:03:22.528 --> 00:03:25.891
levels. Generally speaking, an organization’s

00:03:25.878 --> 00:03:29.021
HR delegation instrument describes a series of

00:03:29.018 --> 00:03:31.551
activities and the authorization level

00:03:31.547 --> 00:03:33.847
or levels associated with it.

00:03:33.845 --> 00:03:36.231
An individual may only exercise authorities

00:03:36.225 --> 00:03:37.631
for which they have received

00:03:37.635 --> 00:03:40.179
appropriate delegation. Consult your

00:03:40.155 --> 00:03:43.639
own organization’s instrument.

00:03:43.615 --> 00:03:46.449
Take what you have learned into real life!<br>

00:03:46.435 --> 00:03:48.129
Your organization will have <br>

00:03:48.126 --> 00:03:49.949
its own ways of doing things.

00:03:49.935 --> 00:03:52.529
As a result, sub-delegation varies from

00:03:52.495 --> 00:03:54.302
one organization to another.

00:03:54.305 --> 00:03:56.928
It is a good practice to question

00:03:56.875 --> 00:03:58.708
if you have the authority to act

00:03:58.706 --> 00:04:01.548
before making an HR decision.

00:04:01.535 --> 00:04:03.178
Take a time out from the course

00:04:03.175 --> 00:04:05.608
and ask your supervisor or an HR advisor <br>

00:04:05.588 --> 00:04:07.556
where you can find your organization’s

00:04:07.535 --> 00:04:10.322
delegation instrument and how it should be used

00:04:10.325 --> 00:04:12.892
for the decisions you are making.

00:04:12.895 --> 00:04:16.152
Some human resources actions such as classification,

00:04:16.155 --> 00:04:20.145
pay, staffing may involve exercising authorities

00:04:20.134 --> 00:04:22.434
from multiple areas.

00:04:22.434 --> 00:04:24.734
Test your knowledge by answering the following

00:04:24.723 --> 00:04:28.536
questions. Select “Submit” when you are done.    <br>
