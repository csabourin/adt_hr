ask yourself the following questions.

00:01:31.733 --> 00:01:33.742
Do my objectives align with

00:01:33.706 --> 00:01:36.052
the higher-level priorities? And,

00:01:36.034 --> 00:01:38.513

by the Clerk of the Privy Council,

00:01:49.581 --> 00:01:53.998
the Treasury Board, deputy heads and management.

00:01:53.986 --> 00:01:57.638
Here are some examples of priorities at this level:

00:01:57.632 --> 00:01:59.037

members of visible minorities.

00:03:21.448 --> 00:03:24.004
The Act requires that every employer identify

00:03:23.986 --> 00:03:26.341
and eliminate employment barriers against

00:03:26.317 --> 00:03:29.200
persons in the identified groups.

00:03:29.186 --> 00:03:31.931
Employers must also institute positive policies and <br>

00:03:31.911 --> 00:03:34.251
practices and make reasonable accommodations

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.554
to ensure their workforce reflects

00:03:36.538 --> 00:03:38.941
the diversity of Canadians.

00:03:38.942 --> 00:03:41.401
The Accessible Canada Act is intended to promote

00:03:41.383 --> 00:03:43.663

00:03:43.651 --> 00:03:47.295

00:03:49.864 --> 00:03:52.056
prevent barriers in seven areas under

00:03:52.057 --> 00:03:54.347

in building their own staffing systems

00:04:04.834 --> 00:04:07.235

and adopt inclusive practices.

00:06:23.988 --> 00:06:26.289

assessment tools to increase the validity 

00:07:30.588 --> 00:07:33.031
and reliability of the assessment;  

00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:35.011
apply to each candidate the same standard

00:09:00.138 --> 00:09:03.243
and approach in order to ensure a fair assessment 

00:09:03.227 --> 00:09:06.091
of each candidate’s qualifications. 

00:09:06.077 --> 00:09:08.421
Use one of the flexibilities provided for 

00:09:08.408 --> 00:09:10.781
in the Public Service Employment Act. 

00:09:10.778 --> 00:09:13.721
For example: focus exclusively on members 

00:09:13.699 --> 00:09:15.999
of designated employment equity groups 

00:09:15.998 --> 00:09:18.180
or expand the area of selection 

00:09:18.178 --> 00:09:20.790
that applies to these groups.  

00:09:20.768 --> 00:09:23.068
Establish an organizational need to 

00:09:23.048 --> 00:09:25.080
select individuals who have declared 

00:09:25.078 --> 00:09:26.913
that they belong to a designated group 

00:09:26.899 --> 00:09:29.199
that is currently or is expected to be 

00:09:29.188 --> 00:09:33.273
under-represented. In a non-advertised process, 

00:09:33.249 --> 00:09:35.373
appoint a person belonging to one 

00:09:35.368 --> 00:09:38.059
of the designated groups.

00:09:38.038 --> 00:09:40.035
Make reasonable decisions based on 

00:09:40.037 --> 00:09:42.235
valid and reliable information related to 

00:09:42.238 --> 00:09:44.905
each candidate and for each process.

00:09:44.908 --> 00:09:47.665
Focus on merit rather than on likeability 

00:09:47.668 --> 00:09:50.401
or other sources of bias.  

00:09:50.388 --> 00:09:53.021
Be able to clearly explain decisions and 

00:09:53.008 --> 00:09:55.241
document appointment information including 

00:09:55.216 --> 00:09:58.300
your decisions and considerations. 

00:10:00.296 --> 00:10:02.860
Take what you have learned into real life!  

00:10:02.845 --> 00:10:04.340
Your organization will have 

00:10:04.336 --> 00:10:06.880
its own ways of doing things.  

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:09.996
As a last step, locate some essential resources 

00:10:09.996 --> 00:10:12.936
to assist you in staffing effectively.

00:10:12.917 --> 00:10:15.770
Your organizational staffing framework.

00:10:15.767 --> 00:10:17.850
The mandate of your organization 

00:10:17.826 --> 00:10:19.640
(enabling legislation)

00:10:19.626 --> 00:10:22.950
Your departmental instrument of sub-delegation

00:10:22.926 --> 00:10:25.535
Staffing policies, direction from the Deputy Head 

00:10:25.517 --> 00:10:28.560
and practices of your organization  

00:10:28.546 --> 00:10:30.770
Identify and meet your HR advisors 

00:10:30.765 --> 00:10:33.989
and consult them before making decisions.   

00:10:33.975 --> 00:10:36.639
And as a sub-delegated manager, you have 

00:10:36.615 --> 00:10:38.799
many different options. Remember to 

00:10:38.794 --> 00:10:40.671
consult your HR advisor.

00:10:40.674 --> 00:10:42.651
Take time out from the course to consult 

00:10:42.634 --> 00:10:44.471
the Public Service Commission’s Guides 

00:10:44.464 --> 00:10:47.431
and Tools web page. These tools are designed 

00:10:47.414 --> 00:10:49.151
to assist managers involved 

00:10:49.134 --> 00:10:51.434
in the appointment process. 

00:10:54.544 --> 00:10:56.135
Test your knowledge by answering 

00:10:56.114 --> 00:10:57.865
the following questions. 

00:10:57.834 --> 00:11:00.134
Select “Submit” when you are done.
