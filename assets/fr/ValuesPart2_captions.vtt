00:00:00.104 --> 00:00:03.454
Values and ethics guide managers in responsible 

00:00:03.454 --> 00:00:06.593
decision making and in exercising due diligence 

00:00:06.577 --> 00:00:09.873
in their responsibilities and accountabilities. 

00:00:09.864 --> 00:00:12.185
The Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector 

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:14.175
and the  Directive on Conflict of Interest, 

00:00:14.167 --> 00:00:16.605
issued under the Policy on People Management, 

00:00:16.604 --> 00:00:19.805
guide all public servants in their professional duties. 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.035
The code and the directive are a condition of 

00:00:22.018 --> 00:00:24.781
employment, which means that all employees must 

00:00:24.748 --> 00:00:27.650
read and agree to them in order to be employed 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.973
in the public service.  

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:32.323
The values and expected behaviours outlined 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.363
in the Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector

00:00:35.353 --> 00:00:37.853
 are at the foundation of good management and 

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:40.603
leadership, and they are a key element in

00:00:40.575 --> 00:00:43.905
upholding integrity and respect.

00:00:43.884 --> 00:00:46.435
When considering a values and ethics decision, 

00:00:46.411 --> 00:00:48.895
ask yourself these questions.

00:00:48.878 --> 00:00:52.129
Do I have the authority to make this decision?   

00:00:52.101 --> 00:00:55.321
Have I considered my options?   

00:00:55.298 --> 00:00:58.531
Have I consulted my resources? 

00:00:58.526 --> 00:01:00.739
A public servant who acts in a manner that 

00:01:00.735 --> 00:01:02.729
violates the Values and Ethics Code for 

00:01:02.728 --> 00:01:05.259
the Public Sector or the Directive on 

00:01:05.243 --> 00:01:08.399
Conflict of Interest may be subject to disciplinary 

00:01:08.407 --> 00:01:10.747
measures, up to and including 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.227
termination of employment.   

00:01:13.232 --> 00:01:15.317
In certain circumstances, public servants could

00:01:15.304 --> 00:01:17.857
even be charged under Canada’s Criminal Code 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:20.053
for breaches of conduct.

00:01:20.052 --> 00:01:22.443
In this section you will learn to

00:01:22.432 --> 00:01:25.963
identify key elements involved in values and ethics,

00:01:25.962 --> 00:01:28.373
recognize harassment and violence,

00:01:28.361 --> 00:01:29.976
recognize the steps in the harassment 

00:01:29.963 --> 00:01:32.334
and violence complaint process, and

00:01:32.335 --> 00:01:35.153
identify acts of wrongdoing as defined by 

00:01:35.141 --> 00:01:38.186
the Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act.

00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:39.476
This section should take you 

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:42.756
approximately 30 minutes to complete. 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.221
Respect for people is one value that must be  

00:01:47.212 --> 00:01:50.011
emphasized among all others.

00:01:49.998 --> 00:01:52.521
Fostering a safe, healthy work environment, 

00:01:52.503 --> 00:01:54.261
including protecting employees from 

00:01:54.261 --> 00:01:56.842
harassment and violence, is a key requirement 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.945
of employers (or deputy heads), as outlined in the 

00:01:59.918 --> 00:02:01.665
Directive on the Prevention and Resolution 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.055
of Workplace Harassment and Violence and 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:05.935
the Work Place Harassment and Violence 

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:08.475
Prevention Regulations. 

00:02:08.465 --> 00:02:10.839
As a manager you are in a position of influence 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.849
and authority. You have a responsibility to

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:17.979
explain and guide your staff in acting ethically,

00:02:17.968 --> 00:02:20.592
be a role model to your team, and 

00:02:20.591 --> 00:02:22.602
apply a values-and-ethics filter 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.660
in executing your responsibilities.

00:02:25.633 --> 00:02:27.923
To help you assess whether the behaviour 

00:02:27.895 --> 00:02:29.582
(an act, comment or display) 

00:02:29.568 --> 00:02:31.422
constitutes harassment and violence, 

00:02:31.423 --> 00:02:34.022
ask yourself the following questions.

00:02:34.016 --> 00:02:36.742
Did I experience or witness unwelcome 

00:02:36.746 --> 00:02:39.032
or offensive behaviour?

00:02:39.018 --> 00:02:41.591
Did it demean, belittle or cause 

00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:44.731
personal humiliation or embarrassment?  

00:02:44.703 --> 00:02:46.561
For a definition of workplace harassment

00:02:46.548 --> 00:02:48.951
and violence and a full list of examples, 

00:02:48.937 --> 00:02:50.894
please consult the web page 

00:02:50.887 --> 00:02:52.734
Requirements for employers to prevent 

00:02:52.736 --> 00:02:53.994
harassment and violence 

00:02:53.977 --> 00:02:56.787
in federally regulated workplaces.

00:02:56.771 --> 00:02:58.471
Harassment and violence can be 

00:02:58.474 --> 00:03:00.684
one severe incident that has a lasting impact 

00:03:00.667 --> 00:03:03.274
on the individual, or it can be a series 

00:03:03.277 --> 00:03:06.054
of objectionable actions, conduct or comments 

00:03:06.051 --> 00:03:09.051
against a person because of, for example, 

00:03:09.033 --> 00:03:13.727
that person’s race, national or ethnic origin, 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.887
religion, age, sexual orientation, gender identity or 

00:03:18.885 --> 00:03:22.369
expression, genetic characteristics, disability 

00:03:22.361 --> 00:03:25.113
or any of the other prohibited grounds listed in 

00:03:25.111 --> 00:03:27.713
the Canadian Human Rights Act. In addition, 

00:03:27.698 --> 00:03:29.963
the United Nations Declaration on the 

00:03:29.948 --> 00:03:32.730
Rights of Indigenous Peoples expands the scope  

00:03:32.717 --> 00:03:35.930
of discrimination to include culture, identity, 

00:03:35.902 --> 00:03:38.911
religion, language, health, 

00:03:38.895 --> 00:03:42.008
education and community.  

00:03:41.983 --> 00:03:44.248
When assessing a situation, consider the severity 

00:03:44.231 --> 00:03:46.828
and impropriety of the act, the circumstances 

00:03:46.822 --> 00:03:49.148
and context of the situation, and whether 

00:03:49.147 --> 00:03:50.931
the behaviour is prohibited under 

00:03:50.917 --> 00:03:54.091
the Canadian Human Rights Act. 

00:03:54.052 --> 00:03:57.361
A formal process is initiated when an employee 

00:03:57.361 --> 00:03:59.691
files a written complaint with the individual

00:03:59.663 --> 00:04:02.151
 or unit responsible for managing harassment 

00:04:02.153 --> 00:04:04.632
and violence complaints.

00:04:04.593 --> 00:04:06.872
For more information on the formal process, 

00:04:06.865 --> 00:04:08.572
please refer to the Work Place Harassment 

00:04:08.576 --> 00:04:11.802
and Violence Prevention Regulations. 

00:04:11.794 --> 00:04:14.092
Harassment and violence is serious and 

00:04:14.082 --> 00:04:16.227
needs to be addressed promptly, 

00:04:16.201 --> 00:04:19.407
with sensitivity, competence and discretion.

00:04:19.401 --> 00:04:21.807
The primary goal is to resolve allegations of 

00:04:21.783 --> 00:04:24.465
harassment and violence with the least disruption 

00:04:24.444 --> 00:04:27.232
to the work environment. To accomplish this,

00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:29.942
 follow the eight steps detailed on this website: 

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:32.212
Resolve a workplace harassment and violence   

00:04:32.196 --> 00:04:34.272
complaint.  The steps include

00:04:34.265 --> 00:04:36.695
acknowledging receipt of the complaint

00:04:36.676 --> 00:04:38.915
and notifying the employee who is the object 

00:04:38.905 --> 00:04:42.205
of the complaint , informing the principle party 

00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:45.235
of the resources available to them, making 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.567
every reasonable effort to resolve the occurrence, 

00:04:47.564 --> 00:04:50.427
and  recording  all occurrences of harassment 

00:04:50.406 --> 00:04:53.637
and violence that have been reported to you.

00:04:55.442 --> 00:04:57.951
During your career in the public service,  

00:04:57.942 --> 00:05:00.001
you may be required to address conflicts of 

00:05:00.002 --> 00:05:02.151
interest between your private and professional 

00:05:02.132 --> 00:05:04.421
activities outside of work and your official 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.071
duties and responsibilities. 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.011
Compliance with the Policy on People Management 

00:05:09.001 --> 00:05:11.084
and the Directive on Conflict of Interest 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.154
is a condition of employment. The directive 

00:05:14.151 --> 00:05:16.534
details requirements for public servants to 

00:05:16.532 --> 00:05:19.414
prevent and deal with any real, apparent or 

00:05:19.401 --> 00:05:21.247
potential conflict of interest during 

00:05:21.231 --> 00:05:24.047
their employment and post-employment.  

00:05:24.042 --> 00:05:26.037
In essence, the directive states that all 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.557
public servants must serve the public interest

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.725
 by taking all possible steps to prevent and resolve, 

00:05:31.724 --> 00:05:34.575
in favour of the public interest, any real, apparent 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.825
or potential conflicts of interest between 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.265
their official responsibilities 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.365
and their private affairs. 

00:05:40.341 --> 00:05:42.705
For example, employment outside of the 

00:05:42.682 --> 00:05:44.395
public service could be seen as a 

00:05:44.381 --> 00:05:47.525
conflict of interest. So, if an employee informs you 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.755
that they are self-employed or are considering 

00:05:49.741 --> 00:05:52.015
a position outside the federal public service, 

00:05:52.002 --> 00:05:55.575
it is your responsibility to ask the employee 

00:05:55.555 --> 00:05:57.325
to review the requirements outlined 

00:05:57.314 --> 00:06:00.175
in the directive, and  write a report 

00:06:00.165 --> 00:06:02.675
to inform the deputy head to determine 

00:06:02.675 --> 00:06:04.679
whether the situation could place the employee 

00:06:04.654 --> 00:06:08.989
in a real, apparent or potential conflict of interest .

00:06:10.004 --> 00:06:12.305
The Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act 

00:06:12.305 --> 00:06:16.118
(PSDPA) establishes a process for public sector 

00:06:16.094 --> 00:06:17.878
employees to come forward if they believe 

00:06:17.864 --> 00:06:19.958
that wrongdoing has occurred or 

00:06:19.925 --> 00:06:22.678
is about to occur in the workplace.

00:06:22.675 --> 00:06:25.304
Wrongdoing is defined under the PSDPA 

00:06:25.294 --> 00:06:27.404
as any of the following:

00:06:27.405 --> 00:06:29.264
breaking laws or regulations,

00:06:29.245 --> 00:06:31.944
misusing public funds or assets,

00:06:31.915 --> 00:06:33.754
gross mismanagement,

00:06:33.745 --> 00:06:36.832
an act or omission that endangers the life, 

00:06:36.805 --> 00:06:41.132
health and safety of Canadians or the environment,

00:06:41.134 --> 00:06:43.435
a serious breach of the public sector 

00:06:43.425 --> 00:06:45.422
or organizational code of conduct, or

00:06:45.425 --> 00:06:47.725
directing or counselling a person 

00:06:47.725 --> 00:06:50.103
to do any of these things.

00:06:50.105 --> 00:06:52.143
The legislation protects public servants’ 

00:06:52.125 --> 00:06:54.483
confidentiality when disclosing suspected 

00:06:54.485 --> 00:06:56.473
wrongdoing and protects them from 

00:06:56.444 --> 00:06:59.163
possible reprisals. As a manager, you have 

00:06:59.144 --> 00:07:01.088
an important role to play in modelling 

00:07:01.074 --> 00:07:03.375
values-based leadership and informing 

00:07:03.375 --> 00:07:05.098
your employees of their rights and 

00:07:05.084 --> 00:07:07.937
options under the PSDPA.

00:07:07.925 --> 00:07:09.717
You may encounter situations where 

00:07:09.694 --> 00:07:12.457
employees disclose wrongdoing to you. 

00:07:12.444 --> 00:07:14.497
It is your role to receive the disclosure, 

00:07:14.485 --> 00:07:17.018
inform your organization’s senior officer 

00:07:17.004 --> 00:07:19.898
for internal disclosure, and protect the identity 

00:07:19.884 --> 00:07:22.518
of those involved in the disclosure process. 

00:07:22.514 --> 00:07:24.178
Employees may also choose to approach 

00:07:24.154 --> 00:07:27.138
the senior officer for internal disclosure  or the

00:07:27.125 --> 00:07:30.578
Public Sector Integrity Commissioner directly. 

00:07:31.804 --> 00:07:34.188
Take what you have learned into real life!  

00:07:34.185 --> 00:07:35.408
Your organization will have 

00:07:35.404 --> 00:07:37.198
its own ways of doing things. 

00:07:37.165 --> 00:07:38.398
Take a time out from the course 

00:07:38.384 --> 00:07:40.685
to do several things.  

00:07:41.845 --> 00:07:43.098
Test your knowledge by answering 

00:07:43.095 --> 00:07:44.878
the following questions. 

00:07:44.856 --> 00:07:47.128
Select “Submit” when you are done.
